Abraham signed agreements with John Booth of Northowram (20th March 1635, re: coal mining in Northowram), John Farrar of Eye wood (7th August 1633, re: coal mining in Hipperholme and Sowerby""), George Denton of Halifax (10th May 1634) & Joseph Lister of Northowram (10th June 1635).""History of Weymouth, Massachusetts"", by George Walter Chamberlain, (Boston, 1923). ""ABRAHAM SHAWE and Bridget arrived from the village of Northowram, in the parish of Halifax, England, to Massachusetts Bay Colony with their children as early 1635 and first settled in Watertown. His house is burned in October 1636, and he removed to Dedham. (Fires started easily in old Colonial homes with thatched roofs). Abraham is an incorporator of Dedham and signed the town covenant. He is made a freeman, 9th March 1636-37.Abraham Shawe is the executor appointed in the will of Henry Best, father of his wife, Bridget, dated 9th March 1627/8 and proved August 1628.During the first year of Dedham's settlement, Abraham proposed the erection of a watermill for the purpose of grinding corn. He is called of Dedham and Weymouth, Suffolk (now Norfolk) Massachusetts, but no indication that he ever lived in Weymouth has been found. The town of Weymouth wanted him to build and operate a mill, but he never lived long enough to do it.The town granted him about 70 acres of land. On 12th February 1636/37, he is granted permission by the town to build a corn mill. Abraham chose a site along the Charles River, but unfortunately died in 1638, leaving his work largely unfinished.Abraham made his will in November of 1638. In 1639, the Shawe family sold the estate in Dedham and moved about 10 miles east to Weymouth.Thomas Lechford wrote in his Note-Book, page 329, that Abraham Shawe, sometime of Halifax, in the County of Yorke, clothier, and late of Dedham in New England, planter, made his will about November 1638, mentioning his eldest son Joseph Shawe, his son-in-law Nicholas Byram, his attorney, Mr. Best of Halifax, his daughters Martha Shawe and Mary, his son John and all his children. He married in Halifax, 24th June 1616, Bridget Best....""Abraham and Bridget...arrived at the Massachusetts Bay Colony with their children around 1635 [CI:187:?1:CI].

He had a grant of 'coal or iron ore which may be found in any common land in this Country's disposing', 2nd November 1637, and it is presumed that he made a search for minerals at a time when great mineral wealth is expected from the earth in New England.

Joseph Shaw and Nicholas Byram [sic] were granted administration of the goods of Abraham Shaw, deceased, on 29th October 1640. His will is made about November 1638. Joseph Shaw is his eldest son.There were seven children, probably all born in England. Only four were named in his will. Some have included the name Mary as another child, because Mary is mentioned in the will of Abraham, but according to Russell K. Shaw, researcher and author of Marietta, Ohio, researcher and author of Marietta, Ohio, ""There is no record of baptism of Mary, and the Mary mentioned in his will is a variation of Maria."" (NEHGR 48:346) This does not include Susanna, claimed by some as his, the first child who would make it eight children, if she is indeed his.The Halifax Coalfields, W.B. Trigg, 1931 in the Halifax Society Journal. The Shaw family is involved in working in coal and ore mining, Clothier and planter. There are many land records which link this family together and to areas in Northowram Twp. In May 1590, there is an inheritance dispute over the Scolecote Brow land between brothers, Thomas and John, sons of Christopher Shawe. Thomas, the defendant retained the land. On 7th October 1600, ""Abraham Shawe, son and heir of Thomas Shawe, deceased,"" paid license on it. In 7th October 1607, in the survey of the manor, Abraham is recorded as the owner of this land, then described as in Northowram, in ye greaveship of Hipperholme, with the same physical description as Sculcote Brow located in Northowram which is a township within the bounds of Halifax Parish in Yorkshire, England. Abraham and his wife Bridget, sold the Sculcotte Brow messuage (containing by estimation twelve acres and three rods) just before 25th September 1635. While in Sculcote, Abraham is trying to borrow money to finance coal mining. He is recorded in Northowram on 5th June 1635 when he gave a bond to Joseph Lister of Netherbrea and would have left for New England at about the same time as his surrender of the copyhold land. He is absent 21st September 1635 from a mandatory appearance at the Court Baron. [CI:121:?1:CI]""The ss. had the estate at Dedham, the rest divided among all his children. Joseph Shaw and Nicholas Byram of Weymouth granted to Robert Mason all their house and grounds in Dedham 1639. It is supposed Byram m. a D. (Susanna) of Abraham, and that he and Joseph, both then of age, sold their lands in Dedham and the family all removed to Weymouth. Byram called John Shaw of Weymouth his brother in 1687."" [CI:122:?1:CI] ""He built the first stone 'carte' bridge across the Charles River to enable the people of that region to come to his mill""[CI:129:?1:CI]Abraham Shawe is believed to be buried at the Old Village Cemetery in a unmarked grave in the older section to the left, Village Avenue, Dedham, Norfolk County, Massachusetts, New England The Oldest stone in this cemetery is 1678.The old Congregational Church in Dedham, Norfolk County, Massachusetts, New England is now the Unitarian Church there.An interesting note: There is a Abraham Shaw alive and well in 1641 Cambridge, Massachusetts well after this ones death, who could this Abraham be? Maybe Jenet Shawe's son out of wedlock? or possibly maybe this Abraham Shawe's son Abraham Shawe Jr? Here is some of the proof: Constable 6 (7) 1638. rem. to Cambridge; town officer 1640 (and moved to Weymouth 1639; see [CI:192:?3:CI]) . (also [CI:188:?4:CI]).""It was ordered, that the constables should informe of newe comers if any be admited wthout license: and to that end warrant to bee sent out to the cunstabels of each towne, to informe the Court of Assistants, wch is to consider of the fines whether to take them or to mitigate them. Onely Willis Kingsbury and Abraham Shawe are appointed for Dedham, there being yet no cunstables chosen there.""He signed the famous compact (also [CI:189:?4:CI]) and is Constable of Dedham, elected 6th September 1638. He removed thence to Cambridge and is a town officer there.Those dates listed in these documents are clearly after the Abraham Shaw's death who is married to Elizabeth Best. At that time, this proves that there is definitely two Abraham Shawe\Shaw's!REFERENCES:The Genealogist 10:1:86-97, ""The English Ancestry of Abraham Shaw of Dedham, Massachusetts (1590-1638).The Genealogist 10:1:99, 104, ""Ancestry of Grace (Shaw) Davis.50 Great Migration Colonists to New England, Threlfall, quoting from NEHGR: 2, 48, 49, 106.

He was proclaimed High King of Ireland, but was eventually defeated and killed in battle. He also held the Scottish title of Earl of Carrick.Edward was a son of Robert de Brus, jure uxoris Earl of Carrick and Marjorie, Countess of Carrick. His date of birth is unknown, but as the second or third of five brothers it was probably not long after his older brother was born in 1274. The Irish medievalist Seán Duffy suggests that he was probably fostered in Ireland as a child. This was a common Scottish and Irish cultural practice, and would tie in with, and perhaps explain, parts of his later life.Edward fought alongside Robert throughout his struggle for the Scottish throne, including his desperate period on the run and as a guerilla. The three younger Bruce brothers Niall, Thomas, and Alexander were all captured and executed by the English during this period, but Edward survived. He played an important role capturing and slighting English-held castles in south-west Scotland. It was him who made a possibly ill-judged pact with the English governor of Stirling Castle, which led to the English sending a large army to relieve the caste. This led to the Battle of Bannockburn on June 23-June 24, 1314, where he commanded a Scottish schiltrom.Some time between 1309 and 1313, Edward was created Earl of Carrick, a title previously held by his maternal grandfather Niall of Carrick, his mother and his elder brother.A probable marriage with Isabel, daughter of John de Strathbogie, 9th Earl of Atholl[1] produced a son, Alexander Bruce, who would later inherit his father's earldom.[citation needed] A record for intended marriage to Isabelle de Ross does exist, dated after the probable death of Isabella de Strathbogie, but there is no evidence that the marriage actually occurred.[citation needed]There are records[citation needed] to suggest a second son, Thomas, was also a result of their union. This second marriage seems improbable as Edward was campaigning in Ireland at the time, and a marriage in the midst of these events is unlikely.Edward obtained a dispensation for a marriage to Isabella of Ross, daughter of Uilleam II, Earl of Ross, on June 1, 1317. Their marriage may or may not have taken place before Edward's death; in any case, they had no children.Battle of FaughartThen in the late summer of 1318, John de Birmingham with his army began a march against Edward the Bruce. On 14 October 1318, the Scots-Irish army was badly defeated at the Battle of Faughart by de Birmmingham's forces. Edward was killed, his body being quartered and send to various towns in Ireland, and his head being delivered to King Edward II. The Annals of Ulster (erroneously under the year 1315) summed up the hostile feeling held by many among the Anglo-Irish and Irish alike of Bruce:""Edward Bruce, the destroyer of Ireland in general, both Foreigners and Gaels, was killed by the Foreigners of Ireland by dint of fighting at Dun-Delgan. And there were killed in his company Mac Ruaidhri, king of Insi-Gall Hebrides [i.e. Alan MacRuari?] and Mac Domnaill, king of Argyle, [i.e. Angus Og of Islay?] together with slaughter of the Men of Scotland around him. And there was not done from the beginning of the world a deed that was better for the Men of Ireland than that deed. For there came death and loss of people during his time in all Ireland in general for the space of three years and a half and people undoubtedly used to eat each other throughout Ireland.""Edward Bruce created havoc in the colonised parts of Ireland, and might be said to have rocked the settlement to its foundations. But notwithstanding this, he failed in the end, and with him the attempt to recreate a kingdom of Ireland and drive out the settlers ceased. From then on the Gaelic revival failed to find a national leader. Its impulse remained local down to the end of the Middle Ages; its success was measured in the innumerable battles fought by local chieftans or confederations of chieftains. So while everywhere the Gaelic recovery of lost territories was remarkable, there was never any serious attempt made to unite Gaelic Ireland or to bring about the downfall of the English government in Ireland and the end of the colony.LegacyEdward Bruce has given rise to the perception that there was a strong fellow feeling amongst mediaeval Scotsmen and Irishmen that they had a common enemy in the shape of England. This is reflected in the 1996 Mel Gibson film Braveheart where Irishmen come to join William Wallace in his fight against Edward I.He is buried on the Cooley peninsula near Dundalk, Co. Louth.Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_BruceThis is not accurate.

He grew up in Weymouth and married about 1650 Alice Phillips (daughter of Nicholas and Elizabeth Phillips of Dedham and Weymouth). He is credited with service under Lt. Upham as a soldier during King Philip's war, and was seventy-four years old when he died in Weymouth September 16, 1704. Administration of his estate was granted October 17, 1704 to his widow Alice, and to his eldest son John, Named in the distribution (March 11, 1705/6) were sons John, Nicholas, Joseph, Benjamin and Ebenezer, daughter Mary King (a widow) and her four sons, Joseph Poole and wife Elizabeth, Gideon Tirrel and wife Hannah, Richard Davenport and wife Abigail, John Androse and wife Alice. Elizabeth Poole was perhaps the Elizabeth Shaw who signed as witness to the will of her grandfather, Nicholas Phillips, in 1671, if a girl of fifteen, as she was then, were allowed as witness.""John, son of Abraham and Bridget Best Shaw, is born in Halifax on 21st May 1630. When he is five years old he arrived with his parents in Watertown, MA, (Rumor has it that there is a passenger list of a ship arriving in Boston, New England and has a record of these Shaw's, I will get info on this later)--lived also in Dedham but settled in Weymouth where he married, in 1655, Alice, daughter of Nicholas and Elizabeth (Jepson) Philips. Alice mentioned in the will of Nicholas Philips, dated 2nd June 1671 and proved 3rd October 1672. John is a Weaver, probably having had experience in the trade before he arrived to New England, small as he was. Yorkshire is sheep and cloth-producing country, and children at the age of four were used in the trade, their little fingers being better suited to tying knots and cutting threads close than those of larger hands. Yorkshire is said to have produced cloth for Charlemagne. And having eleven children, he seems to have had quite a constant supply of little fingers... John lived in the times when the Indians are carrying on raids and burning and scalping. These culminated in King Philip's War, during which John served as Lieutenant and no doubt had his share in the ruthless punishment meted out to the Indians at the close of the Swamp Fight...Probably most of the men who took part in this war had been born in England.

A monastic patron, he is remembered as the founder of Gisborough Priory in Yorkshire, in present-day Redcar and Cleveland, in 1119.[1]BiographyRobert is given by some Victorian historians as a son of Adam de Brus, by his spouse Emma de Ramsay.[2][3] Cokayne states that the family name is derived from Bruis, now Brix, in the arrondissement of Valognes.[4] Some modern historians contend that the name may have come from Brix, Manche, near Cherbourg in the Cotentin Peninsula, and that they came to England after King Henry I of England's conquest of Normandy (i.e.: at the same time as Alan fitz Flaad, the FitzAlan ancestor of the Stuart Royal Family, notwithstanding that they were Bretons).What is known clearly is that this Robert de Brus is first mentioned during the period 1094 and 1100, as a witness to a charter of Hugh, Earl of Chester, granting the church of Flamborough, Yorkshire, to Whitby Abbey. Possibly the Earl of Chester about 1100–1104 enfeoffed Robert of certain portions of his Cleveland fee in Lofthouse, Upleatham, Barwick, Ingleby, and other places.Between 1103–1106 Robert de Brus attested with Ralph de Paynel and 16 others a charter of William, Count of Mortain, to the abbey of Marmoutier. In 1109 at a Council of all England held at Nottingham, he attested the charter of King Henry I confirming to the church of Durham certain possessions which the men of Northumberland had claimed. During the period 1109–1114 he appears in early charters in possession of numerous other manors and lands in Yorkshire, and in the same period he attested a charter of Henry I issued at Woodstock, Oxfordshire.He appears in the Lindsey Survey made 1115–1118 in possession of even further lands. There is a strong presumption that the King had given Robert his Yorkshire fee soon after the battle of Tinchebrai (28 September 1106).Robert was present at the great gathering of northern magnates at Durham in 1121, and sometime during the period 1124–1130 he was with the King at Brampton. About 1131 he was in the retinue of Henry I at Lions, in Eure. At about the same time he attested with three of his personal knights a confirmation with Alan de Percy to the monks of Whitby.[5]It is said that Robert had been given some 80 manors in Yorkshire by King Henry. It is evident that Robert kept up his connexions with other Normans too. A member of the Feugeres family, of Feugeres, Calvados, arr.Bayeux, canton of Isigny, witnessed charters of this Robert de Brus circa 1135 in Yorkshire.[6]ScotlandThe friendship between Robert de Brus and David FitzMalcolm (after 1124 King David I of Scotland), who was present in France with King Henry and was granted much of the Cotentin Peninsula, may have commenced at least as early as 1120, at Henry's Court.[7] When David became king, he settled upon his military companion and friend the Lordship of Annandale, in 1124,[8] There is, however, scant evidence that this Robert ever took up residence on his Scottish estates.After the death of King Henry, David refused to recognise Henry's successor, King Stephen. Instead, David supported the claim of his niece and Stephen's cousin, Empress Matilda, to the English throne and taking advantage of the chaos in England due to the disputed succession there, he took the chance to realise his son's claim to Northumberland. These actions Robert de Brus of Annandale could not countenance and as a result he and King David parted company, with Robert bitterly renouncing his homage to David before taking the English side at the Battle of the Standard in 1138.[9] Before the battle, Robert had made an impassioned plea to David, calling to his remembrance how he and other Normans had by their influence in Scotland, as far back as 1107, obliged King Alexander to give a part of the Scottish Kingdom to his brother David. The appeal was in vain. Robert, and his eldest son Adam, joined the English army, while his younger son, Robert, with an eye on his Scottish inheritance, fought for David.[10]MarriageRobert is said to have married twice:(1) Agnes, daughter of Geoffrey Bainard, Sheriff of York and(2) Agnes, daughter and heiress of Fulk de Paynel of Carleton, North Yorkshire.[11][12] Farrer mentions both marriages and in particular points out that the superior of Carleton Manor was de Brus, and that Paynel held it of him.It is unclear by which spouse his sons were, but authorities usually give her as Agnes de Paynel.Adam de Brus I, eldest son and heir upon whom devolved, under feudal law, all the English estates.[13] He only survived his father by 12 months, his wife's name not known in the records.[14]Robert de Brus, the younger son, upon whom his father had settled the Scottish Lordship of Annandale, plus several wheat-producing ploughates at Skelton, Yorkshire, in his lifetime.[15][16]Footnotes^ Sherlock, Stephen.

David probably supposed that the experience of Bruce in governing his own English lordships would conduce to the good rule and civilisation of the extensive Border lordship of Annandale, which formed the middle or third division of the county of Dumfries. The other two divisions of that county are Nithsdale on the west, and Eskdale on the east. But whatever were the real motives, whether of private friendship or public policy, of King David in making such a munificent grant, Bruce soon entered into possession of the district of Annandale, and governed it successfully from 1124 till the year 1138, when the Battle of the Standard, which was fought on 22d August that year on Cutton Moor, near Northallerton, changed the relations between King David and his favourite grantee of Annandale. The latter almost passionately endeavoured to dissuade the king against his ill-advised war with England. Bruce's address to his sovereign on that occasion was more in the style and language of an independent sovereign than a subject of Scotland as lord of Annandale. But his advice and his entreaties were disregarded, and the war proved disastrous to the Scots. Bruce did not long survive that battle, having died in May 1141, after governing Annandale for seventeen years.His second son, also named Robert, succeeded to Annandale, and was the second Robert Brace of Annandale from 1141 to 1190. He made charter grants of the lauds and fishings in Annandale to his friends and followers, as appears from the charters still preserved.King William the Lion confirmed to this second Robert Bruce of Annandale all the land which his father and himself held in the dale of Annan by the same marches by which his father held it, and he after his father, to himself and his heirs in fee and heritage, as freely as ever his father or he himself held that land of King David, the grandfather of King William, or of King Malcolm his brother. That confirmation charter excepted the rights of the king's royalty, which are enumerated as causes of treasure trove, murder, assault aforethought, rape, arson, robbery, which are reserved to the king. King William also granted to Bruce that these causes should be brought into court by one of the men of his fief to be chosen by the king, and pleaded before his justices. The grantee is to take the like customs as are exacted at Roxburgh, except the assize of his barony. That charter bears no date, but it must have been granted between 1165, when King William succeeded his brother King Malcolm, and 1191, when Robert Bruce the son of the grantee is proved to have been dead. The confirmation of King William now recited bears to have been granted at ""Locmaban."" lCHARTERS BY THE BRUCES OF ANNANDALE.William De Bruce, The Fourth Of Annandale.The Christian name of Robert prevailed so much in the Bruce family as to be almost hereditary in the eight generations which existed between the father of the Robert Bruce, first of Annandale, and his descendant Robert Bruce of Annandale and King of Scotland. The fourth Lord of Annandale appears to have been on the same terms of intimacy with King William as had subsisted between King David and the first Bruce of Annandale. William Bruce granted several charters of lands in Annandale, which are printed in this work.The fifth Bruce of Annandale was Robert, who succeeded his father William Bruce. Robert married the Princess Isabel, second daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon, younger brother of King William the Lion.This royal marriage ultimately led to the descendant of the Bruces becoming King of Scotland.The sixth Bruce of Annandale was Robert, who was the eldest son and successor of his father Bobert and the Princess Isabel his wife. In the year 1249-50 he was one of the Lords Justices of the common pleas of England. At first sight such a position indicates incompatibility with the ownership of Annandale. But the connections of the Bruces with England were from the first fully more prominent than with Scotland. The Lord Justice was afterwards made Sheriff of Cumberland and Governor of Carlisle, and in the following year, 1255, he was made one of the Regents of Scotland. He sat in the parliament at Brigham on 18th July 1290 as Lord Of Annandale. On the death of Margaret of Norway in the same year, Brace entered his claim to the crown of Scotland as nearest heir to King Alexander the Third. But his claim was repelled by King Edward the First on 17th November 1292. This Eobert Bruce is best known in history as the Competitor. He resigned his right in favour of his son Robert Bruce, who had become Earl of Carrick, and died at his castle of Loch1nabeu in 1295, aged 85.There are several charters of special interest granted by the Bruces. The charter by Robert de Bruce in favour of Ivo and his heirs appears as the foundation charter of the family of Kirkpatrick. The charter bears no date, but, from the names of the witnesses, it must have been granted about the year 1190 by the second Robert Bruce of Annandale. It is very brief, as will be seen from an exact facsimile here introduced.1 The third charter is by William Bruce, either the son or the brother of Eobert Bruce, the granter of the charter to Ivo. Like the first charter, this one bears no date; but, from the names of the witnesses mentioned in it, it was probably granted between the years 1194 and 1214. But while in the first charter Ivo is designated simply by his Christian name, he is in the second charter designated ""Ivo of Kirkpatrick.""2 This is an instance of a person in the twelfth century, having only a Christian and no surname, taking a surname in addition to his Christian name from lauds acquired by him and transmitting the surname to his successors.11 Charter printed p. 1 of this volume. 2 Ibid. i<\,. 2, 3 of this volume.Another of the Bruce charters is granted by Robert Bruce to Roger Crispin of the land of Cnoculeran. This charter is not dated, but was probably granted between the years 1215, when the granter succeeded to his father, William Bruce, and when Robert himself died in 1245. The two seals of the granter are still appended to the charter, both bearing the well-known saltire of the Bruce, and the lion passant in chief. Drawings of both these seals are given on the back of the lithograph of the charter. The ink in which that charter is written is even yet, after the lapse of six centuries, as clear and glossy as when it was originally engrossed. This will be seen from the facsimile here introduced. The charter is printed in this volume.Egbert Bruce, Earl Of Carrick, Father Of King Eobert.Robert Bruce, the seventh Lord of Annandale, augmented his territorial possessions by a romantic marriage with Marjory,2 Countess of Carriuk in her own right. The marriage took place in 1271. Obscurity hangs over that marriage as well as the inheritance of the dignity of Earl of Carrick. The countess appears to have been recognised as owner of the earldom. But no patent of the peerage is known to exist, and the terms of the limitations are not in any known record. After his marriage Bruce appears as Earl of Carrick. But whether he was so styled in virtue of the courtesy in his wife's title, or under a new creation in his own right, does not appear. Of that marriage were bom twelve children, five sons and seven daughters. The daughters and their marriages are stated by Mrs. Gumming Bruce in her recent work, ""The Bruces and the Cumyns."" A question has often been raised as to the birthplace of King Robert the Bruce. Some writers contend for Lochmaben Castle. But as his father and mother lived at the castle of Turnbery in Carrick, where the Countess's numerous family of sons and daughters appear to have been born, the probability is that the king was also born there.1A charter was granted by the seventh Lord of Annandale, also under the title of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick and Lord of Annandale, to Sir William of Carlyle, knight, of a piece of land for the increase of the land of Kynemund, which is minutely described.2Another charter was granted by "" Robertus de Bruys, comes de Carrik, et dominus Vallis Anandie,"" to Alexander de Kethe, of the granter's tenement in Langforgrund. The charter bears no date. The granter's seal is still appended and entire. The shield bears the Bruce saltire and a chief. These were the armorial bearings of the Bruces before the marriage with the Countess of Carrick. Bruce took the name and style of Earl of Carrick ; but he continued to carry his own arms without any addition or impaling those of his wife. The legend reads "" S. Roberti de Brvs."" s This charter has been lithographed for this work and is here introduced. It is printed at length in the Appendix along with a translation. The handwriting is a very favourable specimen of a charter of the thirteenth century.The eighth Bruce of Annandale was the most renowned and illustrious of them all, the hero of Bannockburn, Robert the First, King of Scotland; and among the numerous charters granted by him to his successful comrade in arms, James, Lord of Douglas, knight, was one of the whole land of Polbuthy [Polmoodie], within the vale of Moffat. The land was to be held by the grantee and his heirs of the king and his heirs for rendering twelve broad arrows yearly. The charter bears date at Abirbrothoc, 15th December 1318.The original charter is still preserved in the Douglas charter-chest, and by the kind permission of the Earl of Home, Baron Douglas of Douglas, a lithograph of it is here introduced. The charter itself is also printed.1 Polbuthy forms part of the extensive Annandale estates, and contains the highest mountain range in the south of Scotland.---------------------------------------------GEN-MEDIEVAL-L From: ""John P.

The 1155 Pipe Roll records ""Agnes de Bruis…p filio suo""[989]. As noted above, this suggests that Agnes was acting for her son, who was a minor at the time, in relation to the property for which the return was made. If this is correct, her son was presumably Robert [II] de Brus, who must have been considerably younger than his [half-]brother Adam [I], and so probably born from a different wife. If this is correct, he had reached the age of majority by 1157 when he is named without his mother in the Pipe Roll (see below). The manuscript history of the Bruce family of Carleton records that “primus Brus de Carleton…Robertus de Brus” granted “villam Anandiæ de regno Scotiæ…et…postea Hert et Hertnesse” to “Robertus filius eius junior”[990].

Two of these three deaths presumably relate to Robert [II] and Robert [III] de Brus, as the same source separately records the deaths of Robert [I], Robert [IV] and Robert [V] de Brus (see above and below).

Her origin is indicated by the charter dated to [1150/60] under which “W. comes Albemarle” granted property to “Eufemie nepti mee uxori Roberti de Brus”[998]. Domesday Descendants speculates that she was the daughter of Guillaume’s brother Enguerrand[999], although there seems no reason to choose one of his brothers over any of the others. Another possibility is that she was the daughter of Guillaume’s sister Mathilde, whose husband Guermond de Picquigny is recorded with a sister named Euphemie.Robert [II] de Brus & his wife had three children:1.

He was the son, perhaps the second son,[1] of Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale.The elder de Brus' allegiances were compromised when David invaded England in the later 1130s, and he had renounced his fealty to David before the Battle of the Standard in 1138. The younger Robert however remained loyal and took over his father's land in Scotland, whilst the English territories remained with the elder Robert and passed to the latter's elder son Adam. Bruce family tradition has it that Robert II was captured by his father at the battle and given over to King Stephen of England.A legend tells that in the 1140s, Robert II was visited at Annan by St Malachy. St Malachy asked Robert to pardon a thief, but Robert hung him anyway, and for this the River Annan destroyed part of his castle and the de Brus line received a curse from the holy man. Robert made Lochmaben the centre of his lordship and constructed a new caput there.Robert was buried at Guisborough Priory in North Riding, Yorkshire, a monastery founded by his father Robert I de Brus. As his eldest son, Robert, predeceased him, he was succeeded by his second son William.He married Euphemia, a daughter of Ingleram de Aumale, who's father was Stephen, Count of Aumale. They had five known children,Robert (d. 1191), eldest son.William (d. 1212).Bernard.Agatha.EuphemiaFootnotes^ Burke's The Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited, and Extinct Peerages of the British Empire 1883: 80ReferencesBurke, Messrs.

David probably supposed that the experience of Bruce in governing his own English lordships would conduce to the good rule and civilisation of the extensive Border lordship of Annandale, which formed the middle or third division of the county of Dumfries. The other two divisions of that county are Nithsdale on the west, and Eskdale on the east. But whatever were the real motives, whether of private friendship or public policy, of King David in making such a munificent grant, Bruce soon entered into possession of the district of Annandale, and governed it successfully from 1124 till the year 1138, when the Battle of the Standard, which was fought on 22d August that year on Cutton Moor, near Northallerton, changed the relations between King David and his favourite grantee of Annandale. The latter almost passionately endeavoured to dissuade the king against his ill-advised war with England. Bruce's address to his sovereign on that occasion was more in the style and language of an independent sovereign than a subject of Scotland as lord of Annandale. But his advice and his entreaties were disregarded, and the war proved disastrous to the Scots. Bruce did not long survive that battle, having died in May 1141, after governing Annandale for seventeen years.His second son, also named Robert, succeeded to Annandale, and was the second Robert Brace of Annandale from 1141 to 1190. He made charter grants of the lauds and fishings in Annandale to his friends and followers, as appears from the charters still preserved.King William the Lion confirmed to this second Robert Bruce of Annandale all the land which his father and himself held in the dale of Annan by the same marches by which his father held it, and he after his father, to himself and his heirs in fee and heritage, as freely as ever his father or he himself held that land of King David, the grandfather of King William, or of King Malcolm his brother. That confirmation charter excepted the rights of the king's royalty, which are enumerated as causes of treasure trove, murder, assault aforethought, rape, arson, robbery, which are reserved to the king. King William also granted to Bruce that these causes should be brought into court by one of the men of his fief to be chosen by the king, and pleaded before his justices. The grantee is to take the like customs as are exacted at Roxburgh, except the assize of his barony. That charter bears no date, but it must have been granted between 1165, when King William succeeded his brother King Malcolm, and 1191, when Robert Bruce the son of the grantee is proved to have been dead. The confirmation of King William now recited bears to have been granted at ""Locmaban."" lCHARTERS BY THE BRUCES OF ANNANDALE.William De Bruce, The Fourth Of Annandale.The Christian name of Robert prevailed so much in the Bruce family as to be almost hereditary in the eight generations which existed between the father of the Robert Bruce, first of Annandale, and his descendant Robert Bruce of Annandale and King of Scotland. The fourth Lord of Annandale appears to have been on the same terms of intimacy with King William as had subsisted between King David and the first Bruce of Annandale. William Bruce granted several charters of lands in Annandale, which are printed in this work.The fifth Bruce of Annandale was Robert, who succeeded his father William Bruce. Robert married the Princess Isabel, second daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon, younger brother of King William the Lion.This royal marriage ultimately led to the descendant of the Bruces becoming King of Scotland.The sixth Bruce of Annandale was Robert, who was the eldest son and successor of his father Bobert and the Princess Isabel his wife. In the year 1249-50 he was one of the Lords Justices of the common pleas of England. At first sight such a position indicates incompatibility with the ownership of Annandale. But the connections of the Bruces with England were from the first fully more prominent than with Scotland. The Lord Justice was afterwards made Sheriff of Cumberland and Governor of Carlisle, and in the following year, 1255, he was made one of the Regents of Scotland. He sat in the parliament at Brigham on 18th July 1290 as Lord Of Annandale. On the death of Margaret of Norway in the same year, Brace entered his claim to the crown of Scotland as nearest heir to King Alexander the Third. But his claim was repelled by King Edward the First on 17th November 1292. This Eobert Bruce is best known in history as the Competitor. He resigned his right in favour of his son Robert Bruce, who had become Earl of Carrick, and died at his castle of Loch1nabeu in 1295, aged 85.There are several charters of special interest granted by the Bruces. The charter by Robert de Bruce in favour of Ivo and his heirs appears as the foundation charter of the family of Kirkpatrick. The charter bears no date, but, from the names of the witnesses, it must have been granted about the year 1190 by the second Robert Bruce of Annandale. It is very brief, as will be seen from an exact facsimile here introduced.1 The third charter is by William Bruce, either the son or the brother of Eobert Bruce, the granter of the charter to Ivo. Like the first charter, this one bears no date; but, from the names of the witnesses mentioned in it, it was probably granted between the years 1194 and 1214. But while in the first charter Ivo is designated simply by his Christian name, he is in the second charter designated ""Ivo of Kirkpatrick.""2 This is an instance of a person in the twelfth century, having only a Christian and no surname, taking a surname in addition to his Christian name from lauds acquired by him and transmitting the surname to his successors.11 Charter printed p. 1 of this volume. 2 Ibid. i<\,. 2, 3 of this volume.Another of the Bruce charters is granted by Robert Bruce to Roger Crispin of the land of Cnoculeran. This charter is not dated, but was probably granted between the years 1215, when the granter succeeded to his father, William Bruce, and when Robert himself died in 1245. The two seals of the granter are still appended to the charter, both bearing the well-known saltire of the Bruce, and the lion passant in chief. Drawings of both these seals are given on the back of the lithograph of the charter. The ink in which that charter is written is even yet, after the lapse of six centuries, as clear and glossy as when it was originally engrossed. This will be seen from the facsimile here introduced. The charter is printed in this volume.Egbert Bruce, Earl Of Carrick, Father Of King Eobert.Robert Bruce, the seventh Lord of Annandale, augmented his territorial possessions by a romantic marriage with Marjory,2 Countess of Carriuk in her own right. The marriage took place in 1271. Obscurity hangs over that marriage as well as the inheritance of the dignity of Earl of Carrick. The countess appears to have been recognised as owner of the earldom. But no patent of the peerage is known to exist, and the terms of the limitations are not in any known record. After his marriage Bruce appears as Earl of Carrick. But whether he was so styled in virtue of the courtesy in his wife's title, or under a new creation in his own right, does not appear. Of that marriage were bom twelve children, five sons and seven daughters. The daughters and their marriages are stated by Mrs. Gumming Bruce in her recent work, ""The Bruces and the Cumyns."" A question has often been raised as to the birthplace of King Robert the Bruce. Some writers contend for Lochmaben Castle. But as his father and mother lived at the castle of Turnbery in Carrick, where the Countess's numerous family of sons and daughters appear to have been born, the probability is that the king was also born there.1A charter was granted by the seventh Lord of Annandale, also under the title of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick and Lord of Annandale, to Sir William of Carlyle, knight, of a piece of land for the increase of the land of Kynemund, which is minutely described.2Another charter was granted by "" Robertus de Bruys, comes de Carrik, et dominus Vallis Anandie,"" to Alexander de Kethe, of the granter's tenement in Langforgrund. The charter bears no date. The granter's seal is still appended and entire. The shield bears the Bruce saltire and a chief. These were the armorial bearings of the Bruces before the marriage with the Countess of Carrick. Bruce took the name and style of Earl of Carrick ; but he continued to carry his own arms without any addition or impaling those of his wife. The legend reads "" S. Roberti de Brvs."" s This charter has been lithographed for this work and is here introduced. It is printed at length in the Appendix along with a translation. The handwriting is a very favourable specimen of a charter of the thirteenth century.The eighth Bruce of Annandale was the most renowned and illustrious of them all, the hero of Bannockburn, Robert the First, King of Scotland; and among the numerous charters granted by him to his successful comrade in arms, James, Lord of Douglas, knight, was one of the whole land of Polbuthy [Polmoodie], within the vale of Moffat. The land was to be held by the grantee and his heirs of the king and his heirs for rendering twelve broad arrows yearly. The charter bears date at Abirbrothoc, 15th December 1318.The original charter is still preserved in the Douglas charter-chest, and by the kind permission of the Earl of Home, Baron Douglas of Douglas, a lithograph of it is here introduced. The charter itself is also printed.1 Polbuthy forms part of the extensive Annandale estates, and contains the highest mountain range in the south of Scotland.------------------------------------------The Lord of Annandale was a sub-comital lordship in southern Scotland (Annandale) established by David I of Scotland by 1124 for his follower Robert de Brus. The following were holders of the officers:Robert II de Brus, le Meschin (the Cadet) (fl. 1138, died c. 1189 or 1194), was a 12th century Norman noble and 2nd Lord of Annandale. He was the son, perhaps the second son,[1] of Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale.The elder de Brus' allegiances were compromised when David I invaded England in the later 1130s, and he had renounced his fealty to David before the Battle of the Standard in 1138. The younger Robert however remained loyal and took over his father's land in Scotland, whilst the English territories remained with the elder Robert and passed to the latter's elder son Adam. Bruce family tradition has it that Robert II was captured by his father at the battle and given over to King Stephen of England.A legend tells that in the 1140s, Robert II was visited at Annan by St Malachy. St Malachy asked Robert to pardon a thief, but Robert hung him anyway, and for this the River Annan destroyed part of his castle and the de Brus line received a curse from the holy man. Robert made Lochmaben the centre of his lordship and constructed a new caput there.He married Euphemia de Crosebi or Crosbj of Aumale, daughter of Sir Adam de Crosebi or Crosbj. They had five known children:Robert (d. 1191), eldest son.William (d. 1212).Bernard.Agatha.Euphemia.Robert was buried at Gisborough Priory in the North Riding, Yorkshire, England, a monastery founded by his father Robert I de Brus.

David in turn was the son of Henry of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon and Northumberland and Ada de Warenne; Henry's parents were King David I of Scotland and Maud of Northumberland.In addition to Annandale, Robert was Lord of Hartlepool in county Durham and Writtle and Hatfield Broadoak in Essex, England. His first wife brought to him the village of Ripe, in Sussex, and his second wife the Lordship of Ireby in Cumberland,His possessions were later increased following the defeat of Simon de Montford at the Battle of Evesham (1265), via a series of grants that included the estates of the former rebel barons Walter de Fauconberg and John de Melsa. Henry III also re-appointed Robert a Justice, and Constable of Carlisle and keeper of the Castle there in 1267, a position he had been sacked from in 1255, for his support during the rebellion.It's believed Robert joined the princes Edward and Edmund on their 1270-4 crusade, as his sons failed to attend.He succeeded in having the young widowed Marjorie of Carrick, heiress of that earldom, married to his son, another Robert Bruce in 1271. She was the daughter of Niall, 2nd Earl of Carrick.Robert Bruce was Regent of Scotland sometime during minority of his second cousin King Alexander III of Scotland (1241-1286) and was occasionally recognized as a Tanist of the Scottish Throne. He was the closest surviving male relative to the king: Margaret of Huntingdon's issue were all females up until birth of Hugh Balliol sometime in the 1260s. When Alexander yet was childless, he was officially named as heir-presumptive, but never gained the throne as Alexander later fathered three children. The succession in the main line of the House of Dunkeld became highly precarious when towards the end of Alexander's reign, all three of his children died within a few years. The middle-aged Alexander III induced in 1284 the Estates to recognize as his heir-presumptive his granddaughter Margaret, called the ""Maid of Norway"", his only surviving descendant. The need for a male heir led Alexander to contract a second marriage to Yolande de Dreux on November 1, 1285. All this was eventually in vain. Alexander died suddenly, in a fall from his horse, when only 45 years old, in 1286. His death ushered in a time of political upheaval for Scotland. His three-year old granddaughter Margaret, who lived in Norway, was recognized as his heir. However, the then 7-year old heiress Margaret died, travelling towards her kingdom, on the Orkney Islands around September 26, 1290. With her death, the main royal line came to an end and thirteen claimants asserted their rights to the Scottish Throne.After this extinction of the senior line of the Scottish royal house (the line of William I of Scotland) David of Huntingdon's descendants were the primary candidates for the throne. The two most notable claimants to the throne, John Balliol and Robert himself (grandfather of Robert The Bruce) represented descent through David's daughters Margaret and Isobel respectively.Robert Bruce pleaded tanistry and proximity of blood in the succession dispute. He descended from the second daughter of David of Huntingdon, whereas John Balliol descended from the eldest, and thus had the lineal right. However, Robert was a second cousin of kings of Scotland and descended in 4th generation from King David I of Scotland, whereas John Balliol was a third cousin of kings and descended in 5th generation from King David I, the most recent common ancestor who had been Scottish king. The ensuing 'Great Cause' was concluded in 1292. It gave the Crown of Scotland to his family's great rival, John Balliol. The events took place as follows:Soon after the death of young queen Margaret, Robert Bruce raised a body of men with the help of the Earls of Mar and Atholl and marched to Perth with a considerable following and uncertain intentions. Bishop Fraser of St. Andrews, worried of the possibility of civil war, wrote to Edward, asking for his assistance in choosing a new monarch.Edward took this chance to demand sasine of the Scottish royal estate, but agreed to pass judgement in return for recognition of his suzerainty. The [guardians of Scotland] denied him this, but Robert Bruce was quick to pay homage. All the claimants swore oaths of homage, but John Balliol was the last to do so. The guardians were forced to concede and were thus reinstated by Edward.Judgement processed slowly. On August 3, 1291 Edward asked both Balliol and Bruce to choose forty auditors while he himself chose twenty-four, to decide the case. After considering all of the arguments, in early November the court decided in favour of John Balliol, having the superior claim in feudal law, not to mention greater support from the kingdom of Scotland. In accordance with this, final judgement was given by Edward on 17 November. On November 30, John Balliol was crowned as King of Scots at Scone Abbey. On December 26, at Newcastle upon Tyne, King John swore homage to Edward I for the kingdom of Scotland. Edward soon made it clear that he regarded the country as his vassal state. The Bruce family thus lost what they regarded as their rightful place on the Scottish throne.(Edward I decided in favor of the senior legitimate heir by primogeniture, John Balliol; however, in 1306, the crown was assumed by a grandson of the Robert himself, who became King Robert I. In doing this, the rightful heir- John Balliol's own son- was smited by his father's misfortune of having been placed on the throne in an inopportune period.)Robert, 5th Lord of Annandale resigned the lordship of Annandale to his son, the Earl of Carrick, as well as his claim to the Crown. Shortly after this, Robert's daughter-in-law Marjorie died in 1292, and on the day of her death his son transferred Carrick to his eldest grandson, the future Robert I of Scotland thus making the boy the Earl of Carrick.In 1292 Robert V de Brus held a market at Ireby, Cumberland, in right of his wife. The following year he had a market at Hartlepool, county Durham within the liberties of the Bishop of Durham.Sir Robert de Brus died at Lochmaben Castle and was buried at Guisborough Priory.Family and childrenHe married firstly May 12, 1240:Isabella, (November 2, 1226- after July 10, 1264), daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 5th Earl of Hertford and 1st Earl of Gloucester and Lady Isabel Marshal of Pembroke, with issue:Isabel (b. 1249 - c1284), married (as his first wife) Sir John FitzMarmaduke, Knt., of Horden, Eighton, Lamesley, Ravensholm, and Silksworth, county Durham, Sheriff of North Durham, and Joint Warden beyond the Scottish Sea between the Forth and Orkney. He fought on the English side at the Battle of Falkirk, July 22, 1298, and was present at the Siege of Caerlaverock Castle in 1300. In 1307 he was commanded to assist the Earl of Richmond in expelling Robert de Brus and the Scottish rebels from Galloway. In 1309 his armour and provisions in a vessel bound for Perth were arrested off Great Yarmouth. He was governor of St. John's Town (Perth) in 1310 until his death. Isabel was buried at Easington, county Durham.[6] Robert VI the Bruce, Earl of Carrick (1253 - 1304)He married, secondly on May 3, 1275 at Hoddam, in the diocese of Glasgow:Christina (d. 1305), daughter and heiress of Sir William de Ireby of Ireby, Cumberland. They had no issue.Preceded by Robert IV de Brus Lord of Annandale 1226 x 1233-1295 Succeeded by Robert VI de BrusAnnadale is located in Dumfries and Galloway (Southwest Scotland)Robert de Brus family was given this land by David I in 1124, as one of the border lordships when David became Prince of the Cumbrians. Along with Carrick, these lands acted as a buffer between the quasi-independent Lordship or Kingdom of Galloway and David's lands of Strathclyde and Cumbria.____________________Pedigree Resource Filename: Robert ""The Competitor"" /de Brus/ (AFN: 9G42-PK) sexo: male nacimiento: 1210 of, Annandale, Dumfriesshire, Scotland defunción: 31 May 1295 Priory, Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, Scotland bautismo en otra Iglesia: (Abt 85-1295) entierro: 17 April 1295 Priory, Guisburn, Yorkshire, England matrimonio: , , , ScotlandPadres: Padre: Robert /de Bruce/ (AFN: 9G42-M7) madre: Isabelle /Huntingdon/ (AFN: 9G42-3G) Matrimonios (1)cónyuge: Isabel /de Clare/ (AFN: 8WKL-7K) matrimonio: , , , ScotlandOcultar hijos (8)hijo 1: Robert /de Brus/ (AFN: 9G45-B3) sexo: male nacimiento: July 1243 of, Annandale, Dumfrieshire, Scotland defunción: antes de 4 April 1304 , , , Palestine entierro: Holme Abbey, Holme Cultram, Cumberland, Englandhijo 2: Bernard /Brus/ (AFN: 9G45-DF) sexo: male nacimiento: aproximadamente 1247 of, Connington, Huntingsonshire, England defunción:hijo 3: William /Brus/ (AFN: 9G45-C8) sexo: male nacimiento: aproximadamente 1248 of, Annandale, Dumfriesshire, Scotland defunción:hijo 4: Richard de /Brus/ (AFN: VB10-P9) sexo: male nacimiento: aproximadamente 1249 of, Annandale, Dumfriesshire, Scotland defunción: antes de 26 January 1286hijo 5: Isabella /Bruce/ (AFN: 9G45-FL) sexo: female nacimiento: aproximadamente 1252 of, , Argyllshire, Scotland defunción: 1300hijo 6: John /Brus/ (AFN: 18KB-T4T) sexo: male nacimiento: 1252 Clackmannan, Clackmannan, Scotland defunción:hijo 7: Alosia /Bruce/ (AFN: 9G45-GR) sexo: female nacimiento: aproximadamente 1254 of, Annandale, Dumfrieshire, Scotland defunción:hijo 8: Christiana /Bruce/ (AFN: 9G45-HX) sexo: female nacimiento: aproximadamente 1256 of, Annandale, Dumfrieshire, Scotland defunción:Fuentes (1) Ancestral File (R) The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Cita de este registro ""Pedigree Resource File,"" database, FamilySearch (http://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.2.1/S5X9-Z4G : accessed 2014-07-30), entry for Robert ""The Competitor"" /de Brus/.",

The story continues that Marjorie was so taken with the messenger that she had him held captive until he agreed to marry her, which he did in 1271. However, since the crusade landed in Acre on May 9th 1271, and only started to engage the Muslims in late June, the story and his participation in the Ninth Crusade are generally discounted.What is recorded, is that in:1264 He had to ransom his own father, after his capture, along with Henry III, Richard of Cornwall, and Edward I at the Battle of Lewes, Sussex.1271 He married, without Scottish Royal consent, Marjory, countess of Carrick. As a result she temporarily loses her castle and estates, regained on payment of a fine.1274 Jul-Sep He is present, along with Alexander III, his Queen Margaret, their children and 100 Scottish lords and knights at the Coronation and accompanying celebrations of Edward I, at Westminster.1278 He swears fealty to Edward I, on behalf of Alexander III at Westminster.Accompanies Alexander III to Tewkesbury1281 He is part of the delegation to Guy of Flanders, to arrange the marriage of the Lord Alexander.1282 He participates and is paid for his services in Edward's Conquest of Wales.1283 June, he is summoned by writ to Shrewsbury, for the trial of David ap Griffith.1285 Jun 1 - Earl & Countess, at Turnberry, grant the men of Melrose abbey certain freedoms, according to English law.1286 He is witness, along with his son Robert, to the grant of the church of Campbeltown to Paisley Abbey.1290 He is party to the Treaty of Birgham.He supports his father's claim to the vacant throne of Scotland, left so on the death of Margaret I of Scotland in 1290. The initial civil proceedings, known as The Great Cause, awarded the Crown to his 2nd cousin and rival, John Balliol.1291 He swears fealty to Edward I as overlord of Scotland.1292 His wife Marjorie dies.November, his father, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale - the unsuccessful claimant - resigns his Lordship of Annandale, and claim to the throne to him, allegedly to avoid having to swear fealty to John. In turn he passes his own Earldom of Carrick, in fee, on to his son Robert.1293 January 1st - His warrener at Gt. Badow, a Richard, is caught poaching venison at Northle.1293 He sets sail for Norway, for the marriage of his daughter Isabel to King Eric II of Norway.1294/5 He returns to England.1295 His father dies.Oct 6, swears fealty to Edward and is made Constable of Carlisle Castle.Refuses a summons to the Scottish host.Annandale is seized, by King John Balliol, and given to John 'The Red' Comyn, Lord of Badenoch.Confirms, to Guisborough Priory, the churches of Annandale and Hart.

She died shortly before September 8, 1331.Shortly after the Battle of Stirling Bridge (1297), Annandale was wasted as retaliation to younger Bruce's actions. Yet, when Edward returned to England after his victory at the Battle of Falkirk, which one source accords to Robert turning the Scottish flank, Annandale and Carrick were excepted from the lordships and lands which he assigned to his followers, father having not opposed Edward and the son being treated as a waverer whose allegiance might still be retained.Robert at that time was old and ill, and there are reports that he wished his son to seek peace with Edward. If not his son's actions could jeopardise his own income, which was primarily derived from his holding's south of the border (est. £340 vs £150[28]). The elder Bruce would have seen that, if the rebellion failed and his son were against Edward, the son would lose everything, titles, lands, and probably his life.It was around this time (1302) that Robert's son submits to Edward I. The younger Robert had sided with the Scottish nationalists since the capture and exile of Balliol. There are many reasons which may have prompted his return to Edward, not the least of which was that the Bruce family may have found it loathsome to continue sacrificing his followers, family and inheritance for King John. There were rumours that John would return with a French army and regain the Scottish throne. Soulis supported his return as did many other nobles, but this would lead to the Bruces losing any chance of ever gaining the throne themselves.His first wife was by all accounts a formidable woman. Marjorie was the daughter and heiress of Niall, 2nd Earl of Carrick. Carrick was a Gaelic Earldom in Southern Scotland. Its territories contained much of today's Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire. The couple held the principal seats of Turnberry Castle and Lochmaben.Bruce in fictionHe was portrayed (as a leper) by Ian Bannen in the 1995 film Braveheart. Braveheart wrongly portrays Robert de Brus as being involved in the capture of William Wallace in Edinburgh; as noted above this Robert de Brus died in 1304 and William Wallace was captured on August 3, 1305 by Sir John de Menteith in Glasgow.Notes^ Richardson, Douglas, Magna Carta Ancestry, Baltimore, Md., 2005: 732, ISBN 0-8063-1759-0^ Dunbar, Sir Alexander H., Bt., Scottish Kings, a Revised Chronology of Scottish History 1005 - 1625, Edinburgh, 1899: 126^ The “Scottish Baronial Research Group”, formed in 1969, first defined the term “Cross-Border Lord”, to categorise the Anglo-Norman families with holdings on both sides of the border, the list includes the Balliol, Bruce, Ross and Vescy.^ Douglas Richardson, Kimball G.

His mother was by all accounts a formidable woman who, legend would have it, kept Robert Bruce's father captive until he agreed to marry her. From his mother, he inherited the Gaelic Earldom of Carrick, and through his father a royal lineage that would give him a claim to the Scottish throne. Although his date of birth is definitely known, his place of birth is less certain, but it was probably Turnberry Castle in Ayrshire.Very little is known of his youth. He could have been sent to be fostered with a local family, as was the custom. It can be presumed that Bruce was raised speaking all the languages of his lineage and nation and was almost certainly fluent in Gaelic and Norman French, with literacy in Latin. Robert's first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by Alasdair MacDomhnaill, Lord of Islay. His name appears in the company of the Bishop of Argyll, the vicar of Arran, a Kintyre clerk, his father and a host of Gaelic notaries from Carrick.He saw the outcome of the 'Great Cause' in 1292, which gave the Crown of Scotland to his distant relative, John Balliol, as unjust. As he saw it, it prevented his branch of the family from taking their place on the Scottish throne. Soon afterwards, his grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale—the unsuccessful claimant—resigned his lordship to Robert de Brus, Bruce's father. Robert de Brus had already resigned the Earldom of Carrick to Robert Bruce, his son, on the day of his wife's death in 1292, thus making Robert Bruce the Earl of Carrick. Both father and son sided with Edward I against Balliol.In April 1294, the younger Bruce had permission to visit Ireland for a year and a half, and, as a further mark of King Edward's favour, he received a respite for all the debts owed by him to the English Exchequer.In 1295, Robert married his first wife, Isabella of Mar (d. before 1302) the daughter of Domhnall I, Earl of Mar (d. after July 1297) by his wife Helen (b. 1246 d. after Feb 1295).Some sources claim that Helen was the daughter of the Welsh ruler Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, Prince of North Wales, Llywelyn 'The Great' (1173–1240) and his spouse Joan, Lady of Wales, an illegitimate child of King John of England. However, as both Llywelyn and Joan were dead by 1246, that theory would most likely be incorrect. However, there are suggestions that Helen may have in fact been the daughter of Llywelyn's son Dafydd ap Llywelyn and his Norman wife Isabella de Braose, of the south Wales dynasty of Marcher Lords.Beginning of the Wars of IndependenceIn August 1296, Bruce and his father swore fealty to Edward I of England at Berwick-upon-Tweed, but in breach of this oath, which had been renewed at Carlisle, the younger Robert supported the Scottish revolt against King Edward in the following year. Urgent letters were sent ordering Bruce to support Edward's commander, John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, (to whom Bruce was related), in the summer of 1297; but instead of complying, Bruce continued to support the revolt against Edward. On 7 July, Bruce and his friends made terms with Edward by a treaty called the Capitulation of Irvine. The Scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will, and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to King Edward. The Bishop of Glasgow, James the Steward, and Sir Alexander Lindsay became sureties for Bruce until he delivered his infant daughter Marjorie as a hostage.Shortly after the Battle of Stirling Bridge, Bruce again defected to the Scots; Annandale was wasted and he burned the English-held castle of Ayr. Yet, when King Edward returned to England after his victory at the Battle of Falkirk, Annandale and Carrick were excepted from the Lordships and lands which he assigned to his followers; Bruce was seen as a waverer whose allegiance could be acquired.After William Wallace resigned as Guardian of Scotland after the Battle of Falkirk, he was succeeded by Robert Bruce and John Comyn as joint Guardians, but they could not see past their personal differences. As a nephew and supporter of John Balliol, and as someone with a rightful claim to the Scottish throne, Comyn was Bruce's enemy. In 1299, William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews, was appointed as a third, neutral Guardian to try and maintain order between Bruce and Comyn. The following year, Bruce finally resigned as joint Guardian and was replaced by Sir Gilbert, 1st Lord de Umfraville (d. before 13 October 1307), Earl of Angus (in right of his mother, Maud, Countess of Angus).In May 1301, Umfraville, Comyn and Lamberton also resigned as joint Guardians and were replaced by Sir John de Soules as sole Guardian. Soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the Bruce nor the Comyn camps and was a patriot. He was an active Guardian and made renewed efforts to have King John returned to the Scottish throne.In July, King Edward I launched his sixth campaign into Scotland. Though he captured Bothwell and Turnberry Castle, he did little to damage the Scots' fighting ability and, in January 1302, agreed to a nine-month truce. It was around this time that Robert the Bruce submitted to Edward, along with other nobles, even though he had been on the side of the patriots until then.There were rumours that Balliol would return to regain the Scottish throne. Soules, who had probably been appointed by King John, supported his return, as did most other nobles, but the return of John as king would lead to the Bruces losing any chance of ever gaining the throne themselves.Robert the Bruce and Isabella of MarHowever, though recently pledged to support King Edward, it is interesting to note that Robert the Bruce sent a letter to the monks at Melrose Abbey in March 1302 which effectively weakened his usefulness to the English king. Apologising for having called the monks' tenants to service in his army when there had been no national call-up, Bruce pledged that, henceforth, he would ""never again"" require the monks to serve unless it was to ""the common army of the whole realm"", for national defence. Bruce also married his second wife that year, Elizabeth de Burgh (d. 26 October 1327), the daughter of Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster, (d. 1326). By Elizabeth he had four children: David II, John (died in childhood), Matilda (who married Thomas Isaac and died at Aberdeen 20 July 1353), and Margaret (who married William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland in 1345).In 1303, Edward invaded again, reaching Edinburgh, before marching to Perth. John Comyn, who was by now Guardian, could not hope to defeat King Edward's forces. Edward stayed in Perth until July, then proceeded via Dundee, Brechin and Montrose, to Aberdeen, where he arrived in August. From there, he marched through Moray to Badenoch, before re-tracing his path back south to Dunfermline. With the country now under submission, all the leading Scots, except for William Wallace, surrendered to Edward in February 1304. Terms of submission were negotiated by John Comyn.The laws and liberties of Scotland were to be as they had been in the days of Alexander III, and any that needed alteration would be with the advice of King Edward and the advice and assent of the Scots nobles.On 11 June 1304, with both of them having witnessed the heroic efforts of their countrymen during King Edward's siege of Stirling Castle, Bruce and William Lamberton made a pact that bound them, each to the other, in “friendship and alliance against all men.” If one should break the secret pact, he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds. The pact is often interpreted as a sign of their deep patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the English.With Scotland defenceless, Edward set about absorbing her into England. Homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs, and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the English parliament to establish rules for the governance of Scotland. For all the apparent participation by Scots in the government, however, the English held the real power. The Earl of Richmond, Edward's nephew, was to head up the subordinate government of Scotland.While all this took place, William Wallace was finally captured near Glasgow and executed on August 23, 1305.Coronation as King of ScotsIn September 1305, Edward ordered Robert Bruce to put his castle at Kildrummy, ""in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for,"" suggesting that King Edward suspected Robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back, however an identical phrase appears in an agreement between Edward and his lieutenant and life-long friend Aymer de Valence. Bruce, as Earl of Carrick and now 7th Lord of Annandale, held huge estates and property in Scotland and a barony and some minor properties in England and had a claim to the Scottish throne. He also had a large family to protect. If he claimed the throne, he would throw the country into yet another series of wars, and if he failed, he would be sacrificing everyone and everything he knew.Bruce, like all his family, had a complete belief in his right to the throne. However his actions of supporting alternately the English and Scottish armies had led to a great deal of distrust towards Bruce among the “Community of the Realm of Scotland”. His ambition was further thwarted by the person of John Comyn. Comyn had been much more resolute in his opposition to the English, he was the most powerful noble in Scotland and was related to many more powerful nobles both within Scotland and England. He also had a powerful claim to the Scottish throne through both his descent from the ancient Celtic monarchy and through his being the nephew of John Balliol. To neutralise this threat, Bruce invited him to a meeting under truce in Dumfries on 10 February 1306.Bruce attacked Comyn before the high altar of the church of the Greyfriars monastery and fled. On being told that Comyn had survived the attack and was being treated, two of Bruce's supporters, Roger de Kirkpatrick and John Lindsay, went back into the church and finished Comyn off. Bruce was excommunicated for this crime, which eventually led to the excommunication first of the barons who supported him and then the entire country.[5] Realising that the 'die had been cast' and he had no alternative except to become king or a fugitive, Bruce asserted his claim to the Scottish crown. He was crowned King of Scots as Robert I at Scone, near Perth on 25 March, by Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, (alleged by the English to be his mistress) who claimed the right of her family, the Macduff Earl of Fife, to place the Scottish king on his throne. Though now king, Bruce did not yet have a kingdom, and his efforts to obtain it were unsuccessful until after the death of King Edward I.From Scone to BannockburnIn June 1306, he was defeated at the Battle of Methven and in August, he was surprised in Strathfillan, where he had taken refuge. The ladies of his family were sent to Kildrummy in January 1307. Bruce, almost without a follower, fled to Rathlin Island off the northern coast of Ireland.Edward I marched north again in the spring. On his way, he granted the Scottish estates of Bruce and his adherents to his own followers and published a bill excommunicating Bruce. Bruce's queen, Elizabeth, his daughter Marjorie, and his sister Mary were captured in a sanctuary at Tain, while his brother Niall was executed. But, on 7 July, King Edward I died, leaving Bruce opposed by his feeble son, Edward II, and the odds turned in Bruce's favour.Bruce and his followers returned to the Scottish mainland in February in two groups. One, led by Bruce and his brother Edward landed at Turnberry Castle and began a guerrilla war in southwest Scotland. The other, led by his brothers Thomas and Alexander, landed slightly further south in Loch Ryan; but they were soon captured and executed. In April, Bruce won a small victory over the English at the Battle of Glen Trool, before defeating Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke at the Battle of Loudoun Hill. Leaving his brother Edward in command in Galloway, he travelled north, capturing Inverlochy and Urquhart Castles, burning Inverness Castle and Nairn to the ground, then unsuccessfully threatening Elgin.Transferring operations to Aberdeenshire in late 1307, he threatened Banff before falling seriously ill, probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign. Recovering, leaving John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan unsubdued at his rear, Bruce returned west to take Balvenie and Duffus Castles, then Tarradale Castle on the Black Isle. Looping back via the hinterlands of Inverness and a second failed attempt to take Elgin, Bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of Comyn at the Battle of Inverurie in May 1308, then overran Buchan and slaughtered the English garrison at Aberdeen.He then crossed to Argyll and defeated another body of his enemies at the Battle of Pass of Brander and took Dunstaffnage Castle, the last major stronghold of the Comyns.[6]In March 1309, he held his first Parliament at St. Andrews, and by August, he controlled all of Scotland north of the River Tay. The following year, the clergy of Scotland recognised Bruce as king at a general council. The support given to him by the church in spite of his excommunication was of great political importance.The next three years saw the capture and reduction of one English-held castle or outpost after another: Linlithgow in 1310, Dumbarton in 1311, and Perth, by Bruce himself, in January 1312. Bruce also made raids into northern England and, landing at Ramsey in the Isle of Man, then laid siege to Castle Rushen in Castletown capturing it on 21 June 1313 to deny the island's strategic importance to the English. In the spring of 1314, Edward Bruce laid siege to Stirling Castle, whose governor, Philip de Mowbray, agreed to capitulate if not relieved before 24 June 1314. In March 1314, Sir James Douglas captured Roxburgh, and Randolph captured Edinburgh Castle. In May, Bruce again raided England and subdued the Isle of Man.The eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the English on even ground have caused many to consider Bruce as one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age. This represented a transformation for one raised as a feudal knight. Bruce secured Scottish independence from England militarily — if not diplomatically — at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.Freed from English threats, Scotland's armies could now invade northern England. Bruce also drove back a subsequent English expedition north of the border and launched raids into Yorkshire and Lancashire.Bruce and IrelandBuoyed by his military successes, Bruce's forces also invaded Ireland in 1315, to free the country from English rule, and to open a second front in the continuing wars with England. The Irish even crowned Edward Bruce as High King of Ireland in 1316. Robert later went there with another army to assist his brother.To go with the invasion, Bruce popularised an ideological vision of a ""Pan-Gaelic Greater Scotia"" with his lineage ruling over both Ireland and Scotland. This propaganda campaign was aided by two factors. The first was his marriage alliance from 1302 with the de Burgh family of the Earldom of Ulster in Ireland; second, Bruce himself on his mother's side of Carrick, was descended from Gaelic royalty - in Scotland. Thus, lineally and geopolitically, Bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pan-Gaelic alliance between Scottish-Irish Gaelic populations, under his kingship.This is revealed by a letter he sent to the Irish chiefs, where he calls the Scots and Irish collectively nostra nacio (our nation), stressing the common language, customs and heritage of the two peoples:"" Whereas we and you and our people and your people, free since ancient times, share the same national ancestry and are urged to come together more eagerly and joyfully in friendship by a common language and by common custom, we have sent you our beloved kinsman, the bearers of this letter, to negotiate with you in our name about permanently strengthening and maintaining inviolate the special friendship between us and you, so that with God's will our nation (nostra nacio) may be able to recover her ancient liberty"".The diplomacy worked to a certain extent, at least in Ulster, where the Scots had some support. The Irish chief, Donal O'Neill, for instance, later justified his support for the Scots to Pope John XXII by saying ""the Kings of Lesser Scotia all trace their blood to our Greater Scotia and retain to some degree our language and customs.""The Bruce campaign to Ireland was characterised by some initial military success. However, the Scots failed to win over the non-Ulster chiefs, or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island, where people couldn't see the difference between English and Scottish occupation. Eventually it was defeated when Edward Bruce was killed at the Battle of Faughart. The Irish Annals of the period described the defeat of the Bruces by the English as one of the greatest things ever done for the Irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging brought on the Irish by both the Scots and the English.DiplomacyRobert Bruce's reign also witnessed some diplomatic achievements. The Declaration of Arbroath of 1320 strengthened his position, particularly vis-à-vis the Papacy. Pope John XXII eventually lifted Bruce's excommunication. In May 1328 King Edward III of England signed the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton, which recognised Scotland as an independent kingdom, and Bruce as its king.DeathRobert the Bruce died on 7 June 1329, at the Manor of Cardross, near Dumbarton He had suffered for some years from what some contemporary accounts describe as an ""unclean ailment""; the traditional view is that he died of leprosy, but this is now disputed[4] with syphilis, psoriasis, motor neurone disease and a series of strokes all proposed as possible alternatives.His body lies buried in Dunfermline Abbey, but according to a death bed decree Sir James Douglas removed and carried his heart 'against the enemies of the name of Christ' , in Moorish Granada, Spain. The decree overrode an earlier written request, dated 13th May 1329 Cardross, that his heart be buried in the monastery at Melrose. Douglas was killed in an ambush whilst carrying out the decree. On realising his imminent death Douglas is said to have thrown the casket containing Bruce's heart ahead of him and shouted ""Onward braveheart, Douglas shall follow thee or die."" According to legend (Fordun Annals), the heart was later recovered by Sir William Keith and taken back to Scotland to be buried at Melrose Abbey, in Roxburghshire, following his earlier decree. In 1996, a casket, thought to contain the heart, was unearthed during construction work.Family and descendantsRobert Bruce had a large family in addition to his wife Elizabeth and his children. There were his brothers, Edward, Alexander, Thomas, and Neil, his sisters Christina, Isabel (Queen of Norway), Margaret, Matilda, and Mary, and his nephews Donald II, Earl of Mar and Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray.In addition to his legitimate offspring, Robert Bruce had several illegitimate children by unknown mothers. His sons were Sir Robert (died 12 August 1332 at the Battle of Dupplin Moor); Walter, of Odistoun on the Clyde, who predeceased his father; and Niall, of Carrick, (died 17 October 1346 at the Battle of Neville's Cross). His daughters were Elizabeth (married Walter Oliphant of Gask); Margaret (married Robert Glen), alive as of 29 February 1364; and Christian of Carrick, who died after 1329, when she was in receipt of a pension.Robert was succeeded by his only legitimate son, the infant David II.Robert's only child by his first marriage, Marjorie Bruce, married Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland (1293–1326). She died on 2 March 1316, near Paisley, Renfrewshire, after being thrown from her horse while heavily pregnant, but the child survived. He was Robert II, who succeeded David II and founded the Stewart dynasty.Bruce's descendants include all later Scottish monarchs (except Edward Balliol whose claim to be a Scottish monarch is debatable) and all British monarchs since the Union of the Crowns in 1603. A large number of families definitely are descended from him but there is some controversy about some claims.LegendsAccording to legend, at some point while he was on the run during the winter of 1305-06, Bruce hid himself in a cave on Rathlin Island off the north coast of Ireland, where he observed a spider spinning a web, trying to make a connection from one area of the cave's roof to another. Each time the spider failed, it simply started all over again until it succeeded. Inspired by this, Bruce returned to inflict a series of defeats on the English, thus winning him more supporters and eventual victory. The story serves to explain the maxim: ""if at first you don't succeed, try try again."" Other versions have Bruce in a small house watching the spider try to make its connection between two roof beams [5]; or, defeated for the seventh time by the English, watching the spider make its attempt seven times, succeeding on the eighth try[citation needed].But this legend appears for the first time in only a much later account, ""Tales of a Grandfather"" by Sir Walter Scott, and may have originally been told about his companion-in-arms Sir James Douglas (the ""Black Douglas""). The entire account may in fact be a version of a literary trope used in royal biographical writing. A similar story is told, for example, in Jewish sources about King David, and in Persian folklore about the Mongolian warlord Tamerlane and an ant.CriticismOn March 21, 2008, Dr. Bruce Durie, academic manager of genealogical studies at the University of Strathclyde, opined in the British daily newspaper The Guardian, ""that despite his romantic reputation, Robert the Bruce was an absolute scoundrel"". ""The first thing he did after taking power was destroy Stirling castle and he was a self-serving, vainglorious opportunist who was determined to be king at any cost,"" Durie added.Scholars of the period might, however, point out that Bruce only slighted Stirling castle to deny it to future English invaders, that he restored the independence of the country by expelling the Occupation government, and that he was a very successful monarch in very difficult circumstances.Source: http://www.patrickspeople.co.uk/ancestors%20of%20isabella%20gordon/2152.htmCrowned King of Scotland, March 27, 1306 at Scone. After a reign of 23 years, he died June 7, 1329Robert I (11 July 1274 – 7 June 1329), popularly known as Robert the Bruce (Medieval Gaelic: Roibert a Briuis; modern Scottish Gaelic: Raibeart Bruis; Norman French: Robert de Brus or Robert de Bruys, Early Scots: Robert Brus), was King of Scots from 1306 until his death in 1329. Robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation, eventually leading Scotland during the Wars of Scottish Independence against England. He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent nation, and is today remembered in Scotland as a national hero.Descended from the Scoto-Norman and Gaelic nobilities, through his father he was a fourth-great grandson of David I, and Robert’s grandfather Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the 'Great Cause'.As Earl of Carrick, Robert the Bruce supported his family’s claim to the throne and took part in William Wallace’s revolt against Edward I of England.In 1298 he became a Guardian of Scotland alongside his great rival for the Scottish throne, John Comyn, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews. Bruce resigned as guardian in 1300 due to his quarrels with Comyn, and in 1302 submitted to Edward I and returned ‘to the king’s peace’. With the death of his father in 1304, Bruce inherited his family’s claim to the throne.In February 1306 following an argument during their meeting at Greyfriars monastery, Dumfries, Bruce killed Comyn. He was excommunicated by the Pope, but absolved by Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow. Robert moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306, at Scone. Edward I’s forces defeated Robert in battle and he was forced to flee into hiding in the Hebrides and Ireland, before returning in 1307 to defeat an English army at Loudoun Hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the English. Robert defeated the Comyns and his other Scots enemies, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands from Buchan to Galloway. In 1309 he was able to hold his first parliament at St Andrews, and a series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland.At the Battle of Bannockburn in June 1314 he defeated a much larger English army under Edward II, confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish monarchy. The battle marked a significant turning point, and, freed from English threats, Scotland's armies could now invade northern England, with Robert launching devastating raids into Lancashire and Yorkshire. Robert also decided to expand his war against the English and create a second front by sending an army under his younger brother, Edward, to invade Ireland, appealing to the native Irish to rise against Edward II's rule.Despite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at Berwick in 1318, Edward II still refused to give up his claim to the overlordship of Scotland. In 1320, the Scottish magnates and nobles submitted the Declaration of Arbroath to Pope John XXII, declaring that Robert was their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland’s status as an independent kingdom. In 1324 the Pope recognized Robert as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326 the Franco-Scottish alliance was renewed in the Treaty of Corbeil. In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, Edward III, and peace was finally concluded between Scotland and England with the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton, by which Edward III renounced all claims to superiority over Scotland.Robert I died on 7 June 1329. His body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey, while his heart was interred in Melrose Abbey. Bruce's lieutenant and friend Sir James Douglas agreed to take the late King's embalmed heart on crusade to the Holy Land, but he only reached Moorish Granada. According to tradition, Douglas was carrying the heart in a silver casket when he died at the head of the Scottish contingent at the Battle of Teba. He was killed in the battle fighting the Moors, but the king's heart was recovered and brought back to Scotland by Sir Symon Locard of Lee (later Lockhart) and Sir William Keith of Galston.Robert I was originally buried in Dunfermline Abbey, traditional resting-place of Scottish monarchs since the reign of Malcolm III. His tomb, imported from Paris, was extremely elaborate, carved from gilded alabaster. It was destroyed at the Reformation, but some fragments were discovered in the 19th century (now in the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh).The site of the tomb in Dunfermline Abbey was marked by large carved stone letters spelling out ""King Robert the Bruce"" around the top of the bell tower, when the eastern half of the abbey church was rebuilt in the first half of the 19th century. In 1974 the Bruce Memorial Window was installed in the north transept, commemorating the 700th anniversary of the year of his birth. It depicts stained glass images of the Bruce flanked by his chief men, Christ, and saints associated with Scotland.A 1929 statue of Robert the Bruce is set in the wall of Edinburgh Castle at the entrance, along with one of William Wallace. In Edinburgh also, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery has statues of Bruce and Wallace in niches flanking the main entrance. The building also contains several frescos depicting scenes from Scots history by William Brassey Hole in the entrance foyer, including a large example of Bruce marshalling his men at Bannockburn.Statues of the Bruce also stand on the battleground at Bannockburn, outside Stirling Castle and Marischal College in Aberdeen.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_I_of_Scotlandhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_the_BruceThe Royal House of Stewart In the late 13th century, Walter Stewart, the 6th High Steward of Scotland, who fought alongside Sir William Wallace and King Robert the Bruce in the Scottish Wars of Independence, was rewarded for his loyalty to King Robert the Bruce by a marriage with Princess Marjorie Bruce, the king's daughter. Walter and Marjorie had a son, Robert Stewart, who became Earl of Strathearn and Menteith. Robert Stewart nearly didn't make it into this world. His mother, Princess Marjorie, was thrown from her horse while she was pregnant. She died from her injuries and Robert was born by an emergency Caesarean section. When Robert the Bruce's son, King David II, died without any male heir then Robert Stewart, Earl of Strathearn and Menteith, was next in line for the throne. He became King Robert II of Scotland, and founder of the Royal House of Stewart, which ruled Scotland for over three hundred years and in 1603 under King James VI became the ruling dynasty of the combined thrones of the United Kingdom. King James VI of Scotland became known as King James I of the United Kingdom and was the patron of the King James Bible. The primary residence of the early Scottish kings was Stirling Castle. In the days of Robert the Bruce, Stirling castle would have been primarily a wooden structure. It was in the time of King Robert II that a stone structure began to replace the earlier wooden one. The North Tower of Robert II's era still stands as part of the castle today. Has Children Robert The BRUCE King Of Scots b: 11 JUL 1274 in Turnberry, Ayrshire, Scotland. He married firstly to Isabella Of MAR b: 1276 in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. They had the following daughter: Has Children Marjorie BRUCE Princess Of Scots b: ABT 1297 in Scotland. Marjorie was only child of Robert I ""the Bruce"" King of Scotland from his marriage to Isabella of Mar. Marjorie was held hostage in the Tower of London by King Edward the Longshanks in order to compel surrender from her father, Robert the Bruce. Marjorie was later freed and married Sir Walter Stewart who was a young knight and sixth family holder of the High Steward of Scotland. This marriage produced a son Robert Stewart who was to later become Robert II, King of Scotland (1371-90). Robert's birth was considered something of a miracle since he was delivered by caesarean section Marjorie died from a fall from her horse. Princess Marjorie married in 1315 in Scotland to Walter STEWART 6th High Steward Of Scotland b: 1293 in Scotland.

David was the only surviving son of his father, King Robert ""the Bruce"". He was married to Princess Joan of England at the age of four(!) and ascended to the throne of Scotland at age five. Thomas Randolph, earl of Moray, was appointed as his guardian. On Randolph's death, David became vulnerable to attack by Edward Balliol, who was being backed by Edward III. David and Joan fled for safety first to Dumbarton Castle and then to France, where they lived in exile for seven years. David led an invasion into Northumberland and captured Hexham, but was captured and taken prisoner by the English, where he was imprisoned for eleven years. Meanwhile Robert the Steward (later King Robert II) ruled in his absence. David died without children and the throne passed to Robert the Steward. Has No Children John BRUCE b: OCT 1327 in Scotland.

His body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey, while his heart was interred in Melrose Abbey. Bruce's lieutenant and friend Sir James Douglas agreed to take the late King's embalmed heart on crusade to the Lord's Sepulchre in the Holy Land, but he only reached Moorish Granada. Douglas was killed in battle during the siege of Teba while fulfilling his promise. His body and the casket containing the embalmed heart were found upon the field. They were both conveyed back to Scotland by Sir William Keith of Galston.[3]Known in modern English as Robert the Bruce (Medieval Gaelic: Roibert a Briuis; modern Scottish Gaelic: Raibeart Bruis; Norman French: Robert de Brus or Robert de Bruys) was King of Scots from 1306 until his death in 1329.His paternal ancestors were of Scoto-Norman heritage (originating in Brieux, Normandy)[3], and his maternal of Franco-Gaelic[4]. He became one of Scotland's greatest kings, as well as one of the most famous warriors of his generation, eventually leading Scotland during the Wars of Scottish Independence against the Kingdom of England. He claimed the Scottish throne as a four-greats-grandson of David I of Scotland, and saw the recognition of Scotland as an independent nation during his reign. Bruce is remembered in Scotland today as a a national hero, similar to George Washington in the American Revolution, and is referred to as ""The Hero King"" by many Scottish writers.His body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey, while his heart is buried in Melrose Abbey.

Robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation, and eventually led Scotland during the first of the Wars of Scottish Independence against England. He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent nation and is today remembered in Scotland as a national hero.Descended from the Anglo-Norman and Gaelic nobilities, his paternal fourth-great grandfather was David I. Robert’s grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the ""Great Cause"". As Earl of Carrick, Robert the Bruce supported his family’s claim to the throne and took part in William Wallace’s revolt against Edward I of England. In 1298, Bruce became a Guardian of Scotland alongside his great rival for the Scottish throne, John Comyn, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews. Bruce resigned as guardian in 1300 due in part to his quarrels with Comyn but chiefly because the restoration of King John seemed imminent. In 1302, he submitted to Edward I and returned to ""the king’s peace"". When his father died in 1304, Bruce inherited his family’s claim to the throne. In February 1306, following an argument during a meeting at Greyfriars monastery, Dumfries, Bruce killed Comyn. He was excommunicated by the Pope but absolved by Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow.Bruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306, at Scone. Edward I’s forces defeated Robert in battle, and Bruce was forced to flee into hiding in the Hebrides and Ireland before returning in 1307 to defeat an English army at Loudoun Hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the English. Bruce defeated the Comyns and his other Scots enemies, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands from Buchan to Galloway. In 1309, he held his first parliament at St Andrews, and a series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland. At the Battle of Bannockburn in June 1314, Bruce defeated a much larger English army under Edward II, confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish monarchy. The battle marked a significant turning point, and, freed from English threats, Scotland's armies could now invade northern England; Bruce launched devastating raids into Lancashire and Yorkshire. He also decided to expand his war against the English and create a second front by sending an army under his younger brother, Edward, to invade Ireland, appealing to the native Irish to rise against Edward II's rule.Despite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at Berwick in 1318, Edward II refused to give up his claim to the overlordship of Scotland. In 1320, the Scottish magnates and nobles submitted the Declaration of Arbroath to Pope John XXII, declaring Bruce as their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland’s status as an independent kingdom. In 1324, the Pope recognised Bruce as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326, the Franco-Scottish alliance was renewed in the Treaty of Corbeil. In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, Edward III, and peace was temporarily concluded between Scotland and England with the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton, by which Edward III renounced all claims to sovereignty over Scotland.Robert the Bruce died on 7 June 1329. His body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey, while his heart was interred in Melrose Abbey. Bruce's lieutenant and friend Sir James Douglas agreed to take the late King's embalmed heart on crusade to the Lord's Sepulchre in the Holy Land, but he reached only as far as Moorish Granada. Douglas was killed in battle during the siege of Teba while fulfilling his promise. His body and the casket containing the embalmed heart were found upon the field. They were both conveyed back to Scotland by Sir William Keith of Galston.[3]Contents [show] Background and early life[edit] Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale, the first of the Bruce, or de Brus, line arrived in Scotland with David I in 1124 and was given the lands of Annandale in Dumfries and Galloway.[4] Robert was the first son of Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, and Marjorie, Countess of Carrick, and claimed the Scottish throne as a fourth great-grandson of David I.[5] His mother was by all accounts a formidable woman who, legend would have it, kept Robert Bruce's father captive until he agreed to marry her. From his mother, he inherited the Earldom of Carrick, and through his father, a royal lineage that would give him a claim to the Scottish throne. The Bruces also held substantial estates in Garioch, Essex, Middlesex, and County Durham.[6]Although Robert the Bruce's date of birth is known,[7] his place of birth is less certain, although it is most likely to have been Turnberry Castle in Ayrshire, the head of his mother’s earldom.[1][7][8][9][10] Very little is known of his youth. He was probably brought up in a mixture of the Anglo-Norman culture of northern England and south-eastern Scotland, and the Gaelic culture of south-west Scotland and most of Scotland north of the River Forth. Annandale was thoroughly feudalised and the form of Northern Middle English that would later develop into the Scots language was spoken throughout the region. Carrick was historically an integral part of Galloway, and though the earls of Carrick had achieved some feudalisation, the society of Carrick at the end of the thirteenth century remained emphatically Celtic and Gaelic speaking.[11]Robert the Bruce would most probably have become trilingual at an early age. He would have spoken both the Anglo-Norman language of his Scots-Norman peers and his father’s family, and the Gaelic language of his Carrick birthplace and his mother’s family. He would also have spoken the early Scots language.[12][13] The family would have moved between the castles of their lordships — Lochmaben Castle, the main castle of the lordship of Annandale, and Turnberry and Loch Doon Castle, the castles of the earldom of Carrick. Robert had nine siblings, and he and his brother Edward may have been fostered according to Gaelic tradition, spending a substantial part of their youth at the courts of other noblemen (Robert’s foster-brother is referred to by Barbour as sharing Robert’s precarious existence as an outlaw in Carrick in 1307-08).[14] As heir, Robert would have been schooled by tutors in all the requirements of courtly etiquette, and he would have waited as a page at his father’s and grandfather’s tables. This grandfather, known to contemporaries as Robert the Noble, and to history as ""Bruce the Competitor"" (because he competed with the other claimants to the throne of Scotland in the ""Great Cause"") seems to have been an immense influence on the future king.[14]Robert's first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by Alexander Og MacDonald, Lord of Islay. His name appears in the company of the Bishop of Argyll, the vicar of Arran, a Kintyre clerk, his father, and a host of Gaelic notaries from Carrick.[15] Robert Bruce, the king to be, was sixteen years of age when Margaret, Maid of Norway died in 1290. It is also around this time that Robert would have been knighted, and he began to appear on the political stage in the Bruce dynastic interest.[16]Robert's mother died early in 1292. In November of the same year Edward I of England, on behalf of the Guardians of Scotland and following the ""Great Cause"", awarded the vacant Crown of Scotland to his grandfather's first cousin once removed, John Balliol.[17] Almost immediately, his grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, resigned his Lordship of Annandale and his claim to the throne to Robert's father. Days later that son, Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, resigned the earldom of Carrick he had held in right of his late wife to their son, Robert, the future king.[18]Even after John's accession, Edward still continued to assert his authority over Scotland and relations between the two kings soon began to deteriorate. The Bruces sided with King Edward against King John and his Comyn allies. Robert the Bruce and his father both considered John a usurper.[19][20] Against the objections of the Scots, Edward I agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of the Guardians that had governed Scotland during the interregnum.[21] A further provocation came in a case brought by Macduff, son of Malcolm, Earl of Fife, in which Edward demanded that John appear in person before the English Parliament to answer the charges.[21] This the Scottish king did, but the final straw was Edward's demand that the Scottish magnates provide military service in England's war against France.[21] This was unacceptable; the Scots instead formed an alliance with France.[22] The Comyn-dominated council acting in the name of King John summoned the Scottish host to meet at Caddonlee on 11 March. The Bruces and the earls of Angus and March refused, and the Bruce family withdrew temporarily from Scotland, while the Comyns seized their estates in Annandale and Carrick, granting them to John Comyn, Earl of Buchan.[20] Edward I thereupon provided a safe refuge for the Bruces, having appointed the Lord of Annandale to the command of Carlisle Castle in October 1295.[23] At some point in early 1296, Robert married his first wife, Isabella of Mar, the daughter of Domhnall I, Earl of Mar and his wife Helen.Beginning of the Wars of Independence[edit]This section needs additional citations for verification.

(March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Drawing of Robert the Bruce and Isabella of Mar, from 1562 Almost the first blow in the war between Scotland and England was a direct attack on the Bruces. On 26 March 1296, Easter Monday, seven Scottish earls made a surprise attack on the walled city of Carlisle, which was not so much an attack against England as the Comyn Earl of Buchan and their faction attacking their Bruce enemies.[24] Both his father and grandfather were at one time Governors of the Castle, and following the loss of Annandale to Comyn in 1295, it was their principal residence. Robert Bruce would have gained first-hand knowledge of the city’s defences. The next time Carlisle was besieged, in 1315, Robert the Bruce would be leading the attack.[23]Edward I responded to King John's alliance with France and the attack on Carlisle by invading Scotland at the end of March 1296 and taking the town of Berwick in a particularly bloody attack upon the flimsy palisades.[25][26] At the Battle of Dunbar, Scottish resistance was effectively crushed.[27] Edward deposed King John, placed him in the Tower of London, and installed Englishmen to govern the country. The campaign had been very successful, but the English triumph would only be temporary.[23][28]Although the Bruces were by now back in possession of Annandale and Carrick, in August 1296 Robert Bruce, Lord of Annandale, and his son, Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick and future king, were among the more than 1,500 Scots at Berwick[29] who swore an oath of fealty to King Edward I of England.[30] When the Scottish revolt against Edward I broke out in July 1297, James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland, led into rebellion a group of disaffected Scots, including Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, MacDuff, the son of the earl of Fife, and the young Robert Bruce.[31] The future king was now twenty-two, and in joining the rebels he seems to have been acting independently of his father, who took no part in the rebellion and appears to have abandoned Annandale once more for the safety of Carlisle. It appears that Robert Bruce had fallen under the influence of his grandfather’s friends, Wishart and Stewart, who had inspired him to resistance.[31] With the outbreak of the revolt, Robert left Carlisle and made his way to Annandale, where he called together the knights of his ancestral lands and, according to the English chronicler Walter of Guisborough, addressed them thus:No man holds his own flesh and blood in hatred and I am no exception. I must join my own people and the nation in which I was born. I ask that you please come with me and you will be my councillors and close comrades""[31][32]Urgent letters were sent ordering Bruce to support Edward's commander, John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey (to whom Bruce was related), in the summer of 1297; but instead of complying, Bruce continued to support the revolt against Edward I. That Bruce was in the forefront of fomenting rebellion is shown in a letter written to Edward by Hugh Cressingham on 23 July 1292, which reports the opinion that ""if you had the earl of Carrick, the Steward of Scotland and his brother…you would think your business done"".[33] On 7 July, Bruce and his friends made terms with Edward by a treaty called the Capitulation of Irvine. The Scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to King Edward. The Bishop of Glasgow, James the Steward, and Sir Alexander Lindsay became sureties for Bruce until he delivered his infant daughter Marjorie as a hostage, which he never did.[citation needed].When King Edward returned to England after his victory at the Battle of Falkirk, the Bruce's possessions were excepted from the Lordships and lands that Edward assigned to his followers. The reason for this is uncertain, though Fordun records Robert fighting for Edward, at Falkirk, under the command of Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham, Annandale and Carrick. This participation is contested as no Bruce appears on the Falkirk roll of nobles present in the English army, and two 19th Century antiquarians: Alexander Murison and George Chalmers have stated Bruce did not participate and in the following month decided to lay waste Annandale and burn Ayr Castle, to prevent it being garrisoned by the English.William Wallace resigned as Guardian of Scotland after his defeat at the Battle of Falkirk. He was succeeded by Robert Bruce and John Comyn as joint Guardians, but they could not see past their personal differences. As a nephew and supporter of King John, and as someone with a serious claim to the Scottish throne, Comyn was Bruce's enemy. In 1299, William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews, was appointed as a third, neutral Guardian to try to maintain order between Bruce and Comyn. The following year, Bruce finally resigned as joint Guardian and was replaced by Sir Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus. In May 1301, Umfraville, Comyn, and Lamberton also resigned as joint Guardians and were replaced by Sir John de Soules as sole Guardian. Soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the Bruce nor the Comyn camps and was a patriot. He was an active Guardian and made renewed efforts to have King John returned to the Scottish throne.In July 1301 King Edward I launched his sixth campaign into Scotland. Though he captured the castles of Bothwell and Turnberry, he did little to damage the Scots' fighting ability, and in January 1302 he agreed to a nine-month truce. It was around this time that Robert the Bruce submitted to Edward, along with other nobles, even though he had been on the side of the Scots until then. There were rumours that John Balliol would return to regain the Scottish throne. Soules, who had probably been appointed by John, supported his return, as did most other nobles. But it was no more than a rumour and nothing came of it.In March 1302 Bruce sent a letter to the monks at Melrose Abbey apologising for having called tenants of the monks to service in his army when there had been no national call-up. Bruce pledged that, henceforth, he would ""never again"" require the monks to serve unless it was to ""the common army of the whole realm"", for national defence. Bruce also married his second wife that year, Elizabeth de Burgh, the daughter of Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster. By Elizabeth he had four children: David II, John (died in childhood), Matilda (who married Thomas Isaac and died at Aberdeen 20 July 1353), and Margaret (who married William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland in 1345).In 1303, Edward invaded again, reaching Edinburgh before marching to Perth. Edward stayed in Perth until July, then proceeded via Dundee, Brechin, and Montrose to Aberdeen, where he arrived in August. From there he marched through Moray to Badenoch before re-tracing his path back south to Dunfermline. With the country now under submission, all the leading Scots, except for William Wallace, surrendered to Edward in February 1304. John Comyn, who was by now Guardian, submitted to Edward. The laws and liberties of Scotland were to be as they had been in the days of Alexander III, and any that needed alteration would be with the assent of King Edward and the advice of the Scots nobles.On 11 June 1304, Bruce and William Lamberton made a pact that bound them, each to the other, in “friendship and alliance against all men.” If one should break the secret pact, he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds. The pact is often interpreted[by whom?] as a sign of their patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the English. Homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs, and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the English parliament to establish rules for the governance of Scotland. The Earl of Richmond, Edward's nephew, was to head up the subordinate government of Scotland. While all this took place, William Wallace was finally captured near Glasgow, and he was hanged, drawn, and quartered in London on 23 August 1305.In September 1305, Edward ordered Robert Bruce to put his castle at Kildrummy, ""in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for,"" suggesting that King Edward suspected Robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back. However, an identical phrase appears in an agreement between Edward and his lieutenant and lifelong friend, Aymer de Valence. A further sign of Edward's distrust occurred on 10 October 1305, when Edward revoked his gift of Sir Gilbert de Umfraville's lands to Bruce that he had made only six months before.[34]Robert Bruce as Earl of Carrick, and now 7th Lord of Annandale, held huge estates and property in Scotland and a barony and some minor properties in England, and a strong claim to the Scottish throne.Murder of John Comyn[edit]The killing of Comyn in the Greyfriars church in Dumfries, as imagined by Felix Philippoteaux, a 19th-century illustrator. Bruce, like all his family, had a complete belief in his right to the throne. However, his actions of supporting alternately the English and Scottish armies had led to a great deal of distrust towards Bruce among the ""Community of the Realm of Scotland"". His ambition was further thwarted by John Comyn, who had been much more resolute in his opposition to the English. Comyn was the most powerful noble in Scotland and was related to many more powerful nobles both within Scotland and England, including relatives that held the earldoms of Buchan, Mar, Ross, Fife, Angus, Dunbar, and Strathearn; the Lordships of Kilbride, Kirkintilloch, Lenzie, Bedrule, and Scraesburgh; and sheriffdoms in Banff, Dingwall, Wigtown, and Aberdeen. He also had a powerful claim to the Scottish throne through his descent from Donald III on his father's side and David I on his mother's side. Comyn was the nephew of John Balliol.According to Barbour and Fordoun, in the late summer of 1305, in a secret agreement sworn, signed, and sealed, John Comyn agreed to forfeit his claim to the Scottish throne in favour of Robert Bruce upon receipt of the Bruce lands in Scotland should an uprising occur led by Bruce.[35] Whether the details of the agreement with Comyn are correct or not, King Edward moved to arrest Bruce while Bruce was still at the English court. Fortunately for Bruce, his friend, and Edward's son-in-law, Ralph de Monthermer learnt of Edward's intention and warned Bruce by sending him twelve pence and a pair of spurs. Bruce took the hint,[36] and he and a squire fled the English court during the night. They made their way quickly for Scotland.According to Barbour, Comyn betrayed his agreement with Bruce to King Edward I, and when Bruce arranged a meeting for 10 February 1306 with Comyn in the Chapel of Greyfriars Monastery in Dumfries and accused him of treachery, they came to blows.[37] Bruce assaulted Comyn in Dumfries before the high altar. The Scotichronicon says that on being told that Comyn had survived the attack and was being treated, two of Bruce's supporters, Roger de Kirkpatrick (uttering the words ""I mak siccar"" (""I make sure"")) and John Lindsay, went back into the church and finished Bruce's work. Barbour, however, tells no such story. Bruce asserted his claim to the Scottish crown and began his campaign by force for the independence of Scotland.Bruce and his party then attacked Dumfries Castle where the English garrison surrendered. Bruce hurried from Dumfries to Glasgow, where his friend and supporter Bishop Robert Wishart granted him absolution and subsequently adjured the clergy throughout the land to rally to Bruce.[38] Nonetheless, Bruce was excommunicated for this crime.[39]English records still in existence today tell a completely different story. They state that the Comyn murder was planned in an attempt to gain the throne of Scotland. For this reason King Edward of England wrote to the Pope and asked for his excommunication of Robert Bruce. No records have ever been found in England stating that King Edward had any knowledge of treachery by Robert Bruce before his acts against Comyn. They state that King Edward did not hear of the murder of John Comyn until several days after his death[citation needed].War of King Robert I[edit]Bruce crowned King of Scots; modern tableau at Edinburgh Castle Six weeks after Comyn was killed in Dumfries, Bruce was crowned King of Scots by Bishop William de Lamberton at Scone, near Perth, on 25 March 1306 with all formality and solemnity. The royal robes and vestments that Robert Wishart had hidden from the English were brought out by the Bishop and set upon King Robert. The bishops of Moray and Glasgow were in attendance as well as the earls of Atholl, Menteith, Lennox, and Mar. The great banner of the kings of Scotland was planted behind his throne.[40]Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan and wife of John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan (a cousin of the murdered John Comyn) arrived the next day, too late for the coronation. She claimed the right of her family, the MacDuff Earl of Fife, to crown the Scottish king for her brother, Donnchadh IV, Earl of Fife, who was not yet of age, and in English hands. So a second coronation was held and once more the crown was placed on the brow of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, Lord of Annandale, King of the Scots.In June 1306 Bruce was defeated at the Battle of Methven. His wife and daughters and other women of the party were sent to Kildrummy in August 1306 under the protection of Bruce's brother Neil Bruce and the Earl of Atholl and most of his remaining men.[41] Bruce fled with a small following of his most faithful men, including Sir James Douglas and Gilbert Hay, Bruce's brothers Thomas, Alexander, and Edward, as well as Sir Neil Campbell and the Earl of Lennox.[42]Edward I marched north again in the spring. On his way, he granted the Scottish estates of Bruce and his adherents to his own followers and had published a bill excommunicating Bruce. Bruce's queen, Elizabeth, his daughter Marjorie, his sisters Christina and Mary, and Isabella MacDuff were captured in a sanctuary at Tain and sent to harsh imprisonment, which included Mary and Isabella being hung in cages at Roxburgh and Berwick castles respectively for about four years, while Bruce's brother Neil was executed by being hanged, drawn, and quartered.[43][44]On 7 July, King Edward I died, leaving Bruce opposed by the king's son, Edward II.It is still uncertain where Bruce spent the winter of 1306–07. Most likely he spent it in the Hebrides, possibly sheltered by Christina of Garmoran, who was married to Bruce's brother-in-law, Duncan, the brother of Bruce's first wife, Isabella of Mar. Ireland is also a serious possibility, and Orkney (under Norwegian rule at the time) or Norway proper (where his sister Isabel Bruce was queen dowager) although unlikely are not impossible.[45] Bruce and his followers returned to the Scottish mainland in February in two groups. One, led by Bruce and his brother Edward landed at Turnberry Castle and began a guerrilla war in south-west Scotland. The other, led by his brothers Thomas and Alexander, landed slightly further south in Loch Ryan, but they were soon captured and executed. In April, Bruce won a small victory over the English at the Battle of Glen Trool, before defeating Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, at the Battle of Loudoun Hill. At the same time, James Douglas made his first foray for Bruce into south-western Scotland, attacking and burning his own castle in Douglasdale. Leaving his brother Edward in command in Galloway, Bruce travelled north, capturing Inverlochy and Urquhart Castles, burning Inverness Castle and Nairn to the ground, then unsuccessfully threatening Elgin.Transferring operations to Aberdeenshire in late 1307, he threatened Banff before falling seriously ill, probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign. Recovering, leaving John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan unsubdued at his rear, Bruce returned west to take Balvenie and Duffus Castles, then Tarradale Castle on the Black Isle. Looping back via the hinterlands of Inverness and a second failed attempt to take Elgin, Bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of Comyn at the Battle of Inverurie in May 1308; he then overran Buchan and defeated the English garrison at Aberdeen. The Harrying of Buchan in 1308 was ordered by Bruce to make sure all Comyn family support was extinguished. Buchan had a very large population because it was the agricultural capital of northern Scotland, and much of its population was loyal to the Comyn family even after the defeat of the Earl of Buchan. Most of the Comyn castles in Moray, Aberdeen, and Buchan were destroyed and their inhabitants killed. Bruce ordered similar harryings in Argyle and Kintyre, in the territories of Clan MacDougall. With these acts, Bruce had successfully destroyed the power of the Comyns, which had controlled much of northern and southwestern Scotland for over a hundred and fifty years. He then crossed to Argyll and defeated the MacDougalls (allies of the Comyns) at the Battle of Pass of Brander and took Dunstaffnage Castle, the last major stronghold of the Comyns.[46]Bruce reviewing troops before the Battle of Bannockburn In March 1309, Bruce held his first Parliament at St. Andrews, and by August he controlled all of Scotland north of the River Tay. The following year, the clergy of Scotland recognised Bruce as king at a general council. The support given to him by the church in spite of his excommunication was of great political importance. Over the next three years, one English-held castle or outpost after another was captured and reduced: Linlithgow in 1310, Dumbarton in 1311, and Perth, by Bruce himself, in January 1312. Bruce also made raids into northern England and, landing at Ramsey in the Isle of Man, then laid siege to Castle Rushen in Castletown, capturing it on 21 June 1313 and denying the island's strategic importance to the English. In the spring of 1314, Edward Bruce laid siege to Stirling Castle, whose governor, Philip de Mowbray, agreed to capitulate if not relieved before 24 June 1314. In March 1314, James Douglas captured Roxburgh, and Randolph captured Edinburgh Castle. In May, Bruce again raided England and subdued the Isle of Man.The eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the English on even ground have caused many to consider Bruce as one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age. This represented a transformation for one raised as a feudal knight.Battle of Bannockburn[edit] Main article: Battle of Bannockburn Bruce secured Scottish independence from England militarily – if not diplomatically – at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. An English army led by Edward II in person trying to relieve the siege of Stirling Castle was decisively defeated in an atypical set-piece battle.Further confrontation with England then the Irish conflict[edit] Main article: Bruce campaign in Ireland Freed from English threats, Scotland's armies could now invade northern England. Bruce also drove back a subsequent English expedition north of the border and launched raids into Yorkshire and Lancashire. Buoyed by his military successes, Bruce's forces also invaded Ireland in 1315, purportedly to free the country from English rule (having received a reply to offers of assistance from Donal O'Neil, king of Tyrone), and to open a second front in the continuing wars with England. The Irish even crowned Edward Bruce as High King of Ireland in 1316. Robert later went there with another army to assist his brother.In conjunction with the invasion, Bruce popularised an ideological vision of a ""Pan-Gaelic Greater Scotia"" with his lineage ruling over both Ireland and Scotland. This propaganda campaign was aided by two factors. The first was his marriage alliance from 1302 with the de Burgh family of the Earldom of Ulster in Ireland; second, Bruce himself, on his mother's side of Carrick, was descended from Gaelic royalty in Scotland as well as Ireland. Bruce's Irish ancestors included Eva of Leinster (d.1188), whose ancestors included Brian Boru of Munster and the kings of Leinster. Thus, lineally and geopolitically, Bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pan-Gaelic alliance between Scottish-Irish Gaelic populations, under his kingship. This is revealed by a letter he sent to the Irish chiefs, where he calls the Scots and Irish collectively nostra nacio (our nation), stressing the common language, customs and heritage of the two peoples:Whereas we and you and our people and your people, free since ancient times, share the same national ancestry and are urged to come together more eagerly and joyfully in friendship by a common language and by common custom, we have sent you our beloved kinsman, the bearers of this letter, to negotiate with you in our name about permanently strengthening and maintaining inviolate the special friendship between us and you, so that with God's will our nation (nostra nacio) may be able to recover her ancient liberty.The diplomacy worked to a certain extent, at least in Ulster, where the Scots had some support. The Irish chief, Donal O'Neil, for instance, later justified his support for the Scots to Pope John XXII by saying ""the Kings of Lesser Scotia all trace their blood to our Greater Scotia and retain to some degree our language and customs.""[47]The Bruce campaign in Ireland was characterised by some initial military success. However, the Scots failed to win over the non-Ulster chiefs or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island, where people couldn't see the difference between English and Scottish occupation. Eventually it was defeated when Edward Bruce was killed at the Battle of Faughart. The Irish Annals of the period described the defeat of the Bruces by the English as one of the greatest things ever done for the Irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging wrought upon the Irish by both the Scots and the English.[48]Diplomacy[edit] The reign of Robert Bruce also included some significant diplomatic achievements. The Declaration of Arbroath of 1320 strengthened his position, particularly vis-à-vis the Papacy, and Pope John XXII eventually lifted Bruce's excommunication. In May 1328 King Edward III of England signed the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton, which recognised Scotland as an independent kingdom, and Bruce as its king.Death[edit]King Robert I is buried in Dunfermline Abbey Robert I had been suffering from a serious illness from at least 1327. The Lanercost Chronicle and Scalacronica state that the king was said to have contracted and died of leprosy.[49] Jean Le Bel also stated that in 1327 the king was a victim of 'la grosse maladie', which is usually taken to mean leprosy.[49] However, the ignorant use of the term 'leprosy' by fourteenth-century writers meant that almost any major skin disease might be called leprosy. The earliest mention of this illness is to be found in an original letter written by an eye-witness in Ulster at the time the king made a truce with Sir Henry Mandeville on 12 July 1327. The writer of this letter reported that Robert I was so feeble and struck down by illness that he would not live, 'for he can scarcely move anything but his tongue'.[49] Barbour writes of the king's illness that 'it began through a benumbing brought on by his cold lying', during the months of wandering from 1306 to 1309.[50] None of the Scottish accounts of his death hint at leprosy. It has been proposed that, alternatively, he may have suffered from tuberculosis, syphilis, motor neurone disease, or a series of strokes.[51] There does not seem to be any evidence as to what the king himself or his physicians believed his illness to be. Nor is there any evidence of an attempt in his last years to segregate the king in any way from the company of friends, family, courtiers, or foreign diplomats.[50]In October 1328 the Pope finally lifted the interdict from Scotland and the excommunication of Robert I.[52] The king’s last journey appears to have been a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Ninian at Whithorn; this was possibly in search of a miraculous cure, or to make his peace with God. With Moray by his side, Robert set off from his manor at Cardross for Tarbert on his 'great ship', thence to the Isle of Arran, where he celebrated Christmas of 1328 at the hall of Glenkill near Lamlash. Thence he sailed to the mainland to visit his son and his bride, both mere children, now installed at Turnberry Castle, the head of the earldom of Carrick and once his own main residence.[49][52] He journeyed overland, being carried on a litter, to Inch in Wigtownshire: houses were built there and supplies brought to that place, as though the king's condition had deteriorated. At the end of March 1329 he was staying at Glenluce Abbey and at Monreith, from where St Ninian’s cave was visited.[52] Early in April he arrived at the shrine of St Ninian at Whithorn. He fasted four or five days and prayed to the saint, before returning by sea to Cardross.[49][52]Barbour and other sources relate that Robert summoned his prelates and barons to his bedside for a final council at which he made copious gifts to religious houses, dispensed silver to religious foundations of various orders, so that they might pray for his soul, and repented of his failure to fulfil a vow to undertake a crusade to fight the 'Saracens' in the Holy Land.[49][52] Robert's final wish reflected conventional piety, and was perhaps intended to perpetuate his memory. After his death his heart was to be removed from his body and borne by a noble knight on a crusade against the Saracens and carried to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, before being brought back to Scotland:[49][52]I will that as soone as I am trespassed out of this worlde that ye take my harte owte of my body, and embawme it, and take of my treasoure as ye shall thynke sufficient for that enterprise, both for your selfe and suche company as ye wyll take with you, and present my hart to the holy Sepulchre where as our Lorde laye, seyng my body can nat come there.[53]Robert died on 7 June 1329, at the Manor of Cardross, near Dumbarton.[54] He died utterly fulfilled, in that the goal of his lifetime's struggle – untrammelled recognition of the Bruce right to the crown – had been realised, and confident that he was leaving the kingdom of Scotland safely in the hands of his most trusted lieutenant, Moray, until his infant son reached adulthood.[55] Six days after his death, to complete his triumph still further, papal bulls were issued granting the privilege of unction at the coronation of future Kings of Scots.[55]Burial[edit] The king's body was embalmed and his sternum was sawn to allow extraction of the heart, which Sir James Douglas placed in a silver casket to be worn on a chain around his neck. The body was taken to Dunfermline Abbey, and Robert I was interred in what was then the very centre of the abbey, beneath the high altar, and beside his queen.[55] The king’s tomb was carved in Paris by Thomas of Chartres from alabaster brought from England and was decorated with gold leaf. The tomb was transported to Dunfermline via Bruges and was erected over the king’s grave in the autumn of 1330. Ten alabaster fragments from the tomb are on display in the National Museum of Scotland and traces of gilding still remain on some of them.[49][55]When a projected international crusade failed to materialise, Douglas and his company sailed to Spain where Alfonso XI of Castile was mounting a campaign against the Moorish kingdom of Granada. According to tradition, Douglas and his company including Sir William de Keith, Sir William de St. Clair of Rosslyn and the brothers Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig and Sir Walter Logan, were received by Alfonso. In August 1330 they participated in the Battle of Teba. As he was pursuing the Moorish cavalry after having fought back a feigned attack, Sir James Douglas took the silver casket containing the heart of Robert the Bruce from his neck, and threw it before him among the enemy, saying, ""Now pass thou onward before us, as thou wert wont, and I will follow thee or die."" The Muslim cavalry, realising the small number of their pursuers, turned around and renewed the fight. Douglas was about to retreat when he noticed Sir William de St. Clair of Rosslyn being surrounded by Moorish warriors, and with his remaining men attempted to relieve him. As the knights were hard pressed and outnumbered by the Moors, Sir James Douglas and most of his men were slain, among them Sir Robert Logan and Sir Walter Logan. A few of the surviving companions of Douglas found both his body and the casket on the battlefield and took care that they were sent back home. The Bruce's heart was brought back to Scotland by Sir Symon Locard of Lee (later Lockhart) and Sir William Keith of Galston.[3][56]In accordance with Bruce's written request, the heart was buried at Melrose Abbey in Roxburghshire.[57] In 1920, the heart was discovered by archaeologists and was reburied, but the location was not marked.[58] In 1996, a casket was unearthed during construction work.[59] Scientific study by AOC archaeologists in Edinburgh, demonstrated that it did indeed contain human tissue and it was of appropriate age. It was reburied in Melrose Abbey in 1998, pursuant to the dying wishes of the King.[58]Discovery of the Bruce's tomb[edit] Main article: Dunfermline AbbeyThe tower of the rebuilt eastern end of the Abbey bears the sculpted words ""King Robert The Bruce"" On 17 February 1818, workmen breaking ground on the new parish church to be built on the site of the eastern choir of Dunfermline Abbey uncovered a vault before the site of the former abbey high altar.[60][61] The vault was covered by two large, flat stones – one forming a headstone, and a larger stone six feet (182 cm) in length, with six iron rings or handles set in it. When these stones were removed, the vault was found to be seven feet (214 cm) in length, 56 cm wide and 45 cm deep.[62] Within the vault, inside the remnants of a decayed oak coffin, there was a body entirely enclosed in lead, with a decayed shroud of cloth of gold over it. Over the head of the body the lead was formed into the shape of a crown.[63] Fragments of marble and alabaster had been found in the debris around the site of the vault several years earlier, which were linked to Robert the Bruce’s recorded purchase of a marble and alabaster tomb made in Paris.[64] The Barons of Exchequer ordered that the vault was to be secured from all further inspection with new stones and iron bars and guarded by the town constables, and that once the walls of the new church were built up around the site, an investigation of the vault and the remains could take place.[65] Accordingly, on 5 November 1819, the investigation took place. The cloth of gold shroud and the lead covering were found to be in a rapid state of decay since the vault had first been opened 21 months earlier.[62] The body was raised up and placed on a wooden coffin board on the edge of the vault. It was found to be covered in two thin layers of lead, each around 5 mm thick. The lead was removed and the skeleton was inspected by James Gregory and Alexander Monro, Professor of Anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. The sternum was found to have been sawn open from top to bottom, permitting removal of the king’s heart after death.[66] A plaster cast was taken of the detached skull by artist William Scoular.[66][67] The bones were measured and drawn, and the king’s skeleton was measured to be 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm). It has been estimated that Bruce may have stood at around 6 feet 1 inch (186 cm) tall as a young man, which by medieval standards was impressive. At this height he would have stood almost as tall as Edward I (6 feet 2 inches; 188 cm).[66]The skeleton, lying on the wooden coffin board, was then placed upon the top of a lead coffin and the large crowd of curious people who had assembled outside the church were allowed to file past the vault to view the king’s remains.[68] It was at this point in the proceedings that some small relics – teeth and finger bones – were allegedly removed from the skeleton. The published accounts of eyewitnesses such as Henry Jardine and James Gregory confirm the removal of small objects at this time.[69] Robert the Bruce’s remains were ceremonially re-interred in the vault in Dunfermline Abbey on 5 November 1819. They were placed in a new lead coffin, into which was poured 1,500 lbs of molten pitch to preserve the remains, before the coffin was sealed.[68]A number of reconstructions of the face of Robert the Bruce have been produced, including those by Richard Neave from the University of Manchester [70] and Peter Vanezis from the University of Glasgow.[71]Issue[edit] Child by Isabella of Mar Name Birth Death Notes Marjory 1296 2 March 1316 Married in 1315 Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland, by whom she had one child (Robert II of Scotland) Children by Elizabeth de Burgh Name Birth Death Notes Margaret unknown 1346/47 Married in 1345 William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland; had son, John (1346-1361).[72] Matilda (Maud) unknown 1353 Married Thomas Isaac;[72] had two daughters.[72] Buried at Dunfermline Abbey David 5 March 1324 22 February 1371 Succeeded his father as King of Scots.

A large number of families definitely are descended from him.[75]Ancestry[edit] [show]Ancestors of Robert the Bruce Monuments and commemoration[edit] Depictions in art[edit]Bruce statue at Stirling Castle by Andrew Currie Robert I was originally buried in Dunfermline Abbey, traditional resting-place of Scottish monarchs since the reign of Malcolm III. His tomb, imported from Paris, was extremely elaborate, carved from gilded alabaster. It was destroyed at the Reformation, but some fragments were discovered in the 19th century (now in the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh).The site of the tomb in Dunfermline Abbey was marked by large carved stone letters spelling out ""King Robert the Bruce"" around the top of the bell tower, when the eastern half of the abbey church was rebuilt in the first half of the 19th century. In 1974 the Bruce Memorial Window was installed in the north transept, commemorating the 700th anniversary of the year of his birth. It depicts stained glass images of the Bruce flanked by his chief men, Christ, and saints associated with Scotland.[76]Bruce statue at the entrance to Edinburgh Castle A 1929 statue of Robert the Bruce is set in the wall of Edinburgh Castle at the entrance, along with one of William Wallace. In Edinburgh also, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery has statues of Bruce and Wallace in niches flanking the main entrance. The building also contains several frescos depicting scenes from Scots history by William Brassey Hole in the entrance foyer, including a large example of Bruce marshalling his men at Bannockburn.Statues of the Bruce also stand on the battleground at Bannockburn, outside Stirling Castle,[77] Marischal College in Aberdeen, and Calgary, Alberta, Canada, near the Alberta College of Art and Design.[78]Banknotes[edit]Statue of king Robert the Bruce in front of Marischal College. From 1981 to 1989, Robert the Bruce was portrayed on £1 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank, one of the three Scottish banks with right to issue banknotes. He was shown on the obverse crowned in battle dress, surrounded by thistles, and on the reverse in full battle armour in a scene from the Battle of Bannockburn.[79] When the Clydesdale Bank discontinued £1 banknotes, Robert The Bruce's portrait was moved onto the bank's £20 banknote in 1990 and it has remained there to date.[80]Music[edit] Robert Burns set his poem Scots Wha Hae, the words of which were originally stated to be taken from Bruce's address to his troops at the Battle of Bannockburn, to an old Scots tune, Hey Tuttie Tatie.[81]As a military march, Marche des soldats de Robert Bruce, this tune is part of the repertoire of the French military.[81][82]Aircraft[edit] The airline British Caledonian, named a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 (G-BHDI) after Robert the Bruce.[83]In popular culture[edit] Robert the Bruce was portrayed by Angus Macfadyen in the film Braveheart, which depicts the beginning of the Wars of Scottish Independence.On their 1996 album Scotland United, German Heavy Metal band Grave Digger released ""The Bruce (The Lion King)"" - a song dedicated to Robert the Bruce and his battle prowess.Legends[edit] According to a legend, at some point while he was on the run during the winter of 1306–07, Bruce hid in a cave on Rathlin Island off the north coast of Ireland, where he observed a spider spinning a web, trying to make a connection from one area of the cave's roof to another. It tried and failed twice, but began again and succeeded on the third attempt. Inspired by this, Bruce returned to inflict a series of defeats on the English, thus winning him more supporters and eventual victory. The story serves to illustrate the maxim: ""if at first you don't succeed, try try try again."" Other versions have Bruce in a small house watching the spider try to make its connection between two roof beams.[84]This legend first appears in a much later account, ""Tales of a Grandfather"" by Sir Walter Scott,[citation needed] and may have originally been told about his companion-in-arms Sir James Douglas (the ""Black Douglas""), who had spent time hiding out in caves within his manor of Lintalee, which was then occupied by the English. The entire account may in fact be a version of a literary trope used in royal biographical writing. A similar story is told, for example, in Jewish sources about King David, and in Persian folklore about the Mongolian warlord Tamerlane and an ant.[85]It is said that at the Battle of Bannockburn, Bruce faced the English Knight Sir Henry de Bohun on the battlefield. Riding with the heavy cavalry, de Bohun caught sight of Bruce, who was armed only with his battle-axe. De Bohun lowered his lance and charged, and Bruce stood his ground. At the last moment, Bruce swiftly dodged the lance, raised in his saddle, and with one mighty swing of his axe, struck Bohun so hard that he split his iron helmet, and his head in two, so powerful that it shattered the very weapon into pieces. Afterwards the King merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe. To this day, the story stands in folklore as a testament of the Scottish People and their culture.Robert I Bruce, King of Scotland was born on 11 July 1274 at Writtle, Chelmsford, Essex, England.2 He was the son of Sir Robert le Brus, 1st Lord Brus and Margaret, Countess of Carrick. He married, firstly, Isabella of Mar, daughter of Donald, 6th Earl of Mar and Helen ferch Llywelyn, circa 1295.2 He married, secondly, Lady Elizabeth de Burgh, daughter of Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster and Margaret (?), in 1302.2 He died on 7 June 1329 at age 54 at Cardoss Castle, Cardross, Argyllshire, Scotland.3 He was buried at Dunfermline Abbey, Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland.3He was created 1st Earl of Carrick [Scotland] on 27 October 1292.4 He succeeded to the title of Lord of Annandale between 1295 and 1304.2 He succeeded to the title of 2nd Lord Brus [E., 1297] circa April 1304.5 On 20 February 1305/6 he was attainted, and his English estates declared forfeit by King Edward I.2 He gained the title of King Robert I of Scotland on 25 March 1306.2 He was crowned King of Scotland on 27 March 1306 at Scone Abbey, Scone, Perthshire, Scotland.2 He fought in the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June 1314 at Bannockburn, Stirlingshire, Scotland.

After William's death, Christina married Patrick Earl of Dunbar. Cawley accepts Christina as William's only wife and mother of his children.

William de Brus thus succeeded his father when the latter died in 1194.William de Brus possessed large estates in the north of England. He obtained from King John, the grant of a weekly market at Hartlepool, and granted lands to the canons of Gisburn.[1] Very little else is known about William's activities. He makes a few appearances in the English government records and witnessed a charter of King William of Scotland.He married a woman called Christina, and had by her at least two sons and one daughter:Robert (his successor)WilliamAgatha married Ralph TailboysNotesBurke, Sir Bernard, CB., LL.D., Ulster King of Arms, The Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited, and Extinct Peerages of the British Empire, London, 1883, p.80.ReferencesBurke, Messrs., John and John Bernard, The Royal Families of England, Scotland, and Wales, with Their Descendants, &c., London, 1848: vol.1, pedigree XXXIV.Northcliffe, Charles B., of Langon, MA., editor, The Visitation of Yorkshire, 1563/4 by William Flower, Norroy King of Arms, London, 1881, p. 40.Duncan, A.

The hedge had to withstand three tides before it was washed away.According to the legend the penance was to be carried until a time when the waters were too high for planting.In 1981 the water was eight feet deep where the hedge is normally planted, so honour was satisfied.https://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:William_Bruce_(21)",

He was Robert de Brus, (1243–soon bef. 4 March 1304), 6th Lord of Annandale, and he had been a companion-in-arms of Adam of Kilconquhar. Marjorie was so taken with him that she had him held captive until he agreed to marry her at Turnberry Castle in 1271. He became Earl of Carrick jure uxoris (in right of his wife). Their children were:1.Christina Bruce2.Robert the Bruce.3.Isabel Bruce (1275–1358), married King Eric II of Norway.4.Niall or Nigel Bruce, executed 1306 in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, England.5.Edward Bruce.6.Sir Thomas Bruce, executed 1307.7.Alexander Bruce, executed 1307.8.Mary Bruce, married 1.Sir Niall Campbell 2.Sir Alexander Fraser of Touchfraser and Cowie.9.Matilda Bruce, married Aodh, Earl of RossMargaret Bruce who married Sir William de Carlyle is thought by Barrow not to be their daughter. There is a traditional story that Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray was the son of Marjorie's daughter from her first marriage with Adam. However this is probably not true; it was probably put forward as an explanation of why Thomas Randolph was described as a nephew of Robert the Bruce. Any daughter of Adam of Kilconquhar would have inherited the Gaelic title in the same way that Marjorie, eldest of four, or perhaps five, daughters did on her father's death. There is evidence that an ""eldest daughter"", unknown to history, married into the family of the earls of Mar, giving rise to the now discounted first marriage of Christina to the son of the earl, Gratney.Marjorie died in before November 1292, at which time her husband transferred Carrick to their eldest son, Robert.From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie,_Countess_of_Carrick___________________Margaret of Carrick1,2,3F, #3117, b. circa 1252, d. before 27 October 1292Father Neil, 2nd Earl of Carrick2,4,3 d. b 1250Mother Isabel d. 1256Margaret of Carrick married Adam de Kilconquhar, 3rd Earl of Carrick, son of Donnchadh of Kilconquhar; Her 1st husband.5,2,4 Margaret of Carrick was born circa 1252.4 She married Sir Robert de Brus, Earl Carrick, Lord Annandale, Sheriff of Cumberland, Governor of Carlisle Castle, son of Sir Robert de Brus, Lord Annandale, Sheriff of Cumberland, Governor of Carlisle Castle and Isabel de Clare, circa 1273 at Turnberry Castle, Ayrshire, Scotland; They had 5 sons (Sir Robert, King of Scotland; Sir Edward, Lord of Galloway, Earl of Carrick, King of Ireland; Thomas; Alexander, Dean of Glasgow; & Sir Neil) and 5 daughters (Isabel, wife of Eric II Magnusson, King of Norway; Mary, wife of Sir Neil Campbell, & of Sir Alexander Fraser, Chamberlain of Scotland; Christian, wife of Sir Christopher de Seton, & of Sir Andrew de Moray; Maud, wife of Hugh, 4th Earl of Ross; & Margaret, wife of Sir William de Carlyle).2,4,3 Margaret of Carrick died before 27 October 1292.4Family 1 Adam de Kilconquhar, 3rd Earl of Carrick d. 1271ChildIsabel de Kilconquhar+Family 2 Sir Robert de Brus, Earl Carrick, Lord Annandale, Sheriff of Cumberland, Governor of Carlisle Castle b.

She was, by all accounts, a formidable woman. Her first husband was Adam de Kilconquhar, who died during the Eighth Crusade in 1270. Marjorie learned of her husband's death when one of his companions-in-arms, the handsome young Robert Bruce, 6th Lord of Annandale arrived at her home at Turnberry Castle to tell her of her loss. Marjorie immediately fell for Robert de Brus and, according to the traditional story, held him prisoner at Turnberry Castle until he agreed to marry her. The wedding duly took place in 1271, and Robert de Brus became Earl of Carrick de jure uxoris (in right of his wife).They went on to have twelve children together, of whom 10 survived childhood. The oldest son, Robert, was born in 1274 and went on to become King Robert the Bruce. One of his older sisters, Lady Christian Bruce, also played an active role in the wars of independence against England. Another, Isabel, married King Eric II and became Queen of Norway. One of the younger sons, Edward Bruce, was crowned High King of Ireland in 1316, and killed in battle in 1318.Three other sons were captured and executed by the English during the wars of independence.Marjorie herself died in 1292. It has sometimes been suggested that in addition to the many children from her second marriage, she also had a son by her first husband, who became Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray. It is unclear whether or not this is true.Robert BRUCE. Born JUL 1244, , , , Scotland.

Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale (1243 - 1304) m Marjory, Countess of Carrick:6th Lord of Annandale (dominus vallis Anandie), jure uxoris Earl of Carrick, Lord of Hartness, Writtle and Hatfield Broad Oak (Wretele et Hatfeud Regis), was a cross-border lord, and participant of the Second Barons' War, Welsh Wars, and First War of Scottish Independence. Legend tells that the 27-year-old Robert de Brus was participating in the Ninth Crusade. When Adam de Kilconquhar, one of his companion-in-arms, fell in 1270, at Acre, Robert was obliged to travel to tell the sad news to Adam's widow Marjorie of Carrick. The story continues that Marjorie was so taken with the messenger that she had him held captive until he agreed to marry her, which he did in 1271. However, since the crusade landed in Acre on May 9 1271, and only started to engage the Muslims in late June, the story and his participation in the Ninth Crusade are generally discounted. Robert's wife Marjorie was the daughter and heiressof Niall, 2nd Earl of Carrick. Carrick was a Gaelic Earldom in Southern Scotland. Its territories contained much of today's Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire. The couple held the principal seats of Turnberry Castle and Lochmaben.Robert and Marjory had the following children:(1) Isabel Brus was born in 1272.(2) Christina Brus was born in 1273.(3) Robert Brus was born in 1274.(4) Neil Brus was born on 1276.(5) Edward Brus was born in 1279.(6) Mary Brus was born in 1282.(7) Margaret Brus was born in 1283.(8) Thomas Brus was born in 1284.(9) Alexander Brus was born in 1285(10) Elizabeth Brus was born in 1286.(11) Matilda / Margery was born in 1287.Source:IGI Individual Record FamilySearch™ International Genealogical Index v5.0North America--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Isabel de Clare PedigreeFemale Family--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Event(s):Birth: 1230 Hereford, , Gloucester, EnglandChristening:Death:Burial:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marriages:Spouse: Robert Bruse IV Family--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Messages:Record submitted by a member of the LDS Church.

Brox on May 9, 2007 - Managed by: Dominique Robson and 235 others - Curated by: Jason Willsof Carrick, Scotland, from 1256 to 1292, and is notable as the mother of Robert the Bruce.She was the daughter and heiress of Niall, Earl of Carrick and Margaret Stewart, and Countess of Carrick in her own right. Her first husband was Adam of Kilconquhar, who died during the Eighth Crusade in 1271. Then, as the story goes, a handsome young man arrived one day to tell her of her husband's death in the Holy Land. He was Robert de Brus, (1243–soon bef. 4 March 1304), 6th Lord of Annandale, and he had been a companion-in-arms of Adam of Kilconquhar. Marjorie was so taken with him that she had him held captive until he agreed to marry her at Turnberry Castle in 1271. He became Earl of Carrick jure uxoris (in right of his wife). Their children were: •1.Christina Bruce •2.Robert the Bruce. •3.Isabel Bruce (1275–1358), married King Eric II of Norway. •4.Niall or Nigel Bruce, executed 1306 in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, England. •5.Edward Bruce. •6.Sir Thomas Bruce, executed 1307. •7.Alexander Bruce, executed 1307. •8.Mary Bruce, married 1.Sir Niall Campbell 2.Sir Alexander Fraser of Touchfraser and Cowie. •9.Matilda Bruce, married Aodh, Earl of RossMargaret Bruce who married Sir William de Carlyle is thought by Barrow not to be their daughter. There is a traditional story that Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray was the son of Marjorie's daughter from her first marriage with Adam. However this is probably not true; it was probably put forward as an explanation of why Thomas Randolph was described as a nephew of Robert the Bruce. Any daughter of Adam of Kilconquhar would have inherited the Gaelic title in the same way that Marjorie, eldest of four, or perhaps five, daughters did on her father's death. There is evidence that an ""eldest daughter"", unknown to history, married into the family of the earls of Mar, giving rise to the now discounted first marriage of Christina to the son of the earl, Gratney.Marjorie died in before November 1292, at which time her husband transferred Carrick to their eldest son, Robert. •From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie,_Countess_of_Carrick___________________ •Margaret of Carrick1,2,3 •F, #3117, b. circa 1252, d. before 27 October 1292 •Father Neil, 2nd Earl of Carrick2,4,3 d. b 1250 •Mother Isabel d. 1256 • Margaret of Carrick married Adam de Kilconquhar, 3rd Earl of Carrick, son of Donnchadh of Kilconquhar; Her 1st husband.5,2,4 Margaret of Carrick was born circa 1252.4 She married Sir Robert de Brus, Earl Carrick, Lord Annandale, Sheriff of Cumberland, Governor of Carlisle Castle, son of Sir Robert de Brus, Lord Annandale, Sheriff of Cumberland, Governor of Carlisle Castle and Isabel de Clare, circa 1273 at Turnberry Castle, Ayrshire, Scotland; They had 5 sons (Sir Robert, King of Scotland; Sir Edward, Lord of Galloway, Earl of Carrick, King of Ireland; Thomas; Alexander, Dean of Glasgow; & Sir Neil) and 5 daughters (Isabel, wife of Eric II Magnusson, King of Norway; Mary, wife of Sir Neil Campbell, & of Sir Alexander Fraser, Chamberlain of Scotland; Christian, wife of Sir Christopher de Seton, & of Sir Andrew de Moray; Maud, wife of Hugh, 4th Earl of Ross; & Margaret, wife of Sir William de Carlyle).2,4,3 Margaret of Carrick died before 27 October 1292.4 •Family 1 Adam de Kilconquhar, 3rd Earl of Carrick d. 1271 •Child •Isabel de Kilconquhar+•Family 2 Sir Robert de Brus, Earl Carrick, Lord Annandale, Sheriff of Cumberland, Governor of Carlisle Castle b.

She was, by all accounts, a formidable woman. Her first husband was Adam de Kilconquhar, who died during the Eighth Crusade in 1270. Marjorie learned of her husband's death when one of his companions-in-arms, the handsome young Robert Bruce, 6th Lord of Annandale arrived at her home at Turnberry Castle to tell her of her loss. Marjorie immediately fell for Robert de Brus and, according to the traditional story, held him prisoner at Turnberry Castle until he agreed to marry her. The wedding duly took place in 1271, and Robert de Brus became Earl of Carrick de jure uxoris (in right of his wife).They went on to have twelve children together, of whom 10 survived childhood. The oldest son, Robert, was born in 1274 and went on to become King Robert the Bruce. One of his older sisters, Lady Christian Bruce, also played an active role in the wars of independence against England. Another, Isabel, married King Eric II and became Queen of Norway. One of the younger sons, Edward Bruce, was crowned High King of Ireland in 1316, and killed in battle in 1318.Three other sons were captured and executed by the English during the wars of independence.Marjorie herself died in 1292. It has sometimes been suggested that in addition to the many children from her second marriage, she also had a son by her first husband, who became Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray. It is unclear whether or not this is true.Robert BRUCE. Born JUL 1244, , , , Scotland.

Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale (1243 - 1304) m Marjory, Countess of Carrick:6th Lord of Annandale (dominus vallis Anandie), jure uxoris Earl of Carrick, Lord of Hartness, Writtle and Hatfield Broad Oak (Wretele et Hatfeud Regis), was a cross-border lord, and participant of the Second Barons' War, Welsh Wars, and First War of Scottish Independence. Legend tells that the 27-year-old Robert de Brus was participating in the Ninth Crusade. When Adam de Kilconquhar, one of his companion-in-arms, fell in 1270, at Acre, Robert was obliged to travel to tell the sad news to Adam's widow Marjorie of Carrick. The story continues that Marjorie was so taken with the messenger that she had him held captive until he agreed to marry her, which he did in 1271. However, since the crusade landed in Acre on May 9 1271, and only started to engage the Muslims in late June, the story and his participation in the Ninth Crusade are generally discounted. Robert's wife Marjorie was the daughter and heiressof Niall, 2nd Earl of Carrick. Carrick was a Gaelic Earldom in Southern Scotland. Its territories contained much of today's Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire. The couple held the principal seats of Turnberry Castle and Lochmaben.Robert and Marjory had the following children:(1) Isabel Brus was born in 1272.(2) Christina Brus was born in 1273.(3) Robert Brus was born in 1274.(4) Neil Brus was born on 1276.(5) Edward Brus was born in 1279.(6) Mary Brus was born in 1282.(7) Margaret Brus was born in 1283.(8) Thomas Brus was born in 1284.(9) Alexander Brus was born in 1285(10) Elizabeth Brus was born in 1286.(11) Matilda / Margery was born in 1287.Source:IGI Individual Record FamilySearch™ International Genealogical Index v5.0North America--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Isabel de Clare PedigreeFemale Family--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Event(s):Birth: 1230 Hereford, , Gloucester, EnglandChristening:Death:Burial:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marriages:Spouse: Robert Bruse IV Family--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Messages:Record submitted by a member of the LDS Church.
